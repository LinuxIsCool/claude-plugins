I want us to expand our horizons. Be aware of claude code, be aware of backlog.md be aware of the capacity
of knowledge graphs at all time. But most importantly, be aware of the power of subagents. I want a subagent
for each faculty of our program. The important thing about subagents is that they work autonomously without
using up the context of the primary agent. So the primary agent can stay fully focused as an orchestrator. 
We want to heavily utilize subagents and we want to heavily utilize claude cli. Let's see if we can start to
utlize subagents and claude cli more often in our workflow. I'm curious if we can even apply a different system
prompt to claude using the cli so that it's not so coding focused. Because claude code tends to break everything
up into bullet points and structures, losing the tonality, and the style, and the motivation of the original prompts.
So can we start leveraging claude code cli to run agentic processes using certain plugins with specific system prompts?

For example, let's first leverage our awareness plugin to learn about the claude cli and other complimentary aspects
of claude code like context and subagents and commands and skills and hooks, and let's learn about how our logging system
works, and let's develop that capacity for the awareness plugin to elegantly and dynamically utlize the claude code
cli to its full potential and even develop further skills and techniques over time for improving its effectiveness of
providing claude code cli services to the team. For example, the first thing I'm wondering if we can do with claude code
is to process my planning note from earlier today, the fusion note, and reflect on that note from the perspective
of a different persona, say, one of our plugin subagents with a specific system prompt inviting the persona
of that plugin agent. In this case it would be nice to have a big data agent or data engineering agent or software
architecture or full stack engineer or backend engineer or frontend engineer or agentic engineer to look
at those notes and be able to provide and maintain their own respective reflections and planning in regards
to those notes, without polluting the main namespace of this repository, like they should manage their own
planning and reflection in their own repository, and perhaps this is a plugin itself, like agentic planning
and reflection. But maybe we are getting ahead of ourselves, let's start simple, start with the research.
