I'm starting a projects plugin marketplace in another directory to be
complimentary to this one, but focused on managing my projects. I'm thinking
about how these two marketplaces can be interoperable. I imagine I will use the
plugins from this repository in the projects in that repository. Each of my projects
will be a plugin, which will be installed locally in the projects marketplace, but the
plugins here will be installed globally so I can use these plugins there.

I want to create a plugin that uses a headless claude to facilitate 
version control on every agent stop hook.

I was thinking about a plugin that has master search capabilities.
The plugin could do hybrid rerank searching over an entire repository.
It could do things like fuzzy search, elastic search, keyword search,
embedding retreival, contextual embeddings, graph RAG, ripgrep, maybe
even some LSP or AST stuff, etc.

I installed 10 official claude community plugins.

Yesterday I got agent names in statusline working and I'm very stoked about that.

Having agent names is so powerful because those agent names can be added to logs,
they can be added to commits, and they can be added to journal entries. They can
also be added to any markdown document that gets created or edited by respective agents.
