OK the voice plugin is under development.

I need to train my mentor up.

Got to get them on the backlog, get them comprehending all aspects of this
repository. Have then be the yang to the explorer's yin. 

Awareness needs to learn how to properly digest all the logs, all the planning
docs, all the journal entries, all the plugins, all the commits.

So much potential for this repository. Turning agents into eliza agents. Giving
them retrieval over historical conversations. Having differentiated agents in
claude. Having agent to agent communication facilitated via the messaging plugin.
Having comprehensive search across all my messaging platforms. Making full
use of the backlog plugin.

I think that might be a next major step for me. Full utilization of the backlog
plugin, with full vector search over backlog items.

I want to create a STEM plugin that builds repositories of STEM knowledge from
the ground up, in chronological order, starting with the greeks, I want the
system to go through history, cataloguing works of scientific literature,
creating knowledge graphs and vector embeddings as it goes. It should maintain
a database of authors and works, theorems, formulas, concepts, definitions,
proofs, examples, claims, etc.

I'm interested in this system mastering the skills of marimo (notebooks), typst
(writing), and manim (animations), and typescript, to translate each work into
these substrates for modern publication and digitalization.

I think it's important to leverage Opencode in this repository. 
So that I'm not so dependent on claude code. 

We may want to abstract some functionality so that it's not directly dependent
on claude code but rather builds a set of interfaces that can work with
opencode.

I'm looking forward to achieving higher levels of coherence and efficiency in
this repository, utilizing orchestration patterns. And utilizing compute infrastructure
beyond claude code. Like how much can we do with Ollama? How much can we do with Haiku?
I'm excited to upratchet productivity while minimizing token usage and costs. 

I'll have to have an offline mode that works without claude code. How much can
we do with Ollama? Building generalized interfaces to LLMs and Agents is going
to be really powerful. 

I want to provide the agents here with better and better search and
comprehension tooling so that they can more precisely grock the repository, and
access exactly the information they need when they need it. It means doing deep
research into concepts of semantic and cognitive density. I think that's one
part where the STEM plugin will come in handy, building from the ground up from
Euclidean Geometry up to Network Sciences and Control Theory. Having a plugin
that has on-demand scientific knowledge and wisdom and expertise, along with
engineering expertise. 

There is a general pattern of equipping agents with higher and higher levels
of knowledge and tooling. This is why the skills framework being offered by
claude code is so incredibly powerful. Being able to package skills, subagents,
commands, and hooks is the AI endgame. 2025 was the year of agents. 2026 will be
the year of plugins.
