OK the voice plugin is under development.

I need to train my mentor up.

Got to get them on the backlog, get them comprehending all aspects of this
repository. Have then be the yang to the explorer's yin. 

Awareness needs to learn how to properly digest all the logs, all the planning
docs, all the journal entries, all the plugins, all the commits.

So much potential for this repository. Turning agents into eliza agents. Giving
them retrieval over historical conversations. Having differentiated agents in
claude. Having agent to agent communication facilitated via the messaging plugin.
Having comprehensive search across all my messaging platforms. Making full
use of the backlog plugin.

I think that might be a next major step for me. Full utilization of the backlog
plugin, with full vector search over backlog items.

I want to create a STEM plugin that builds repositories of STEM knowledge from
the ground up, in chronological order, starting with the greeks, I want the
system to go through history, cataloguing works of scientific literature,
creating knowledge graphs and vector embeddings as it goes. It should maintain
a database of authors and works, theorems, formulas, concepts, definitions,
proofs, examples, claims, etc.

I'm interested in this system mastering the skills of marimo (notebooks), typst
(writing), and manim (animations), and typescript, to translate each work into
these substrates for modern publication and digitalization.

I think it's important to leverage Opencode in this repository. 
So that I'm not so dependent on claude code. 

We may want to abstract some functionality so that it's not directly dependent
on claude code but rather builds a set of interfaces that can work with
opencode. 

---

I'm looking forward to achieving higher levels of coherence and efficiency in
this repository, utilizing orchestration patterns. And utilizing compute infrastructure
beyond claude code. Like how much can we do with Ollama? How much can we do with Haiku?
I'm excited to upratchet productivity while minimizing token usage and costs. 

I'll have to have an offline mode that works without claude code. How much can
we do with Ollama? Building generalized interfaces to LLMs and Agents is going
to be really powerful. 

I want to provide the agents here with better and better search and
comprehension tooling so that they can more precisely grock the repository, and
access exactly the information they need when they need it. It means doing deep
research into concepts of semantic and cognitive density. I think that's one
part where the STEM plugin will come in handy, building from the ground up from
Euclidean Geometry up to Network Sciences and Control Theory. Having a plugin
that has on-demand scientific knowledge and wisdom and expertise, along with
engineering expertise. 

There is a general pattern of equipping agents with higher and higher levels
of knowledge and tooling. This is why the skills framework being offered by
claude code is so incredibly powerful. Being able to package skills, subagents,
commands, and hooks is the AI endgame. 2025 was the year of agents. 2026 will be
the year of plugins.

Similar to the above, a plugin that catalogues books. Starting with the ancients and progressing in time.

---

Similar to the above, an agent that catalogues photographs, from the oldest to the newest.

---

Similar to the above, and agent that catalogues videos and movies and telivision shows.

---

Similar to the above, an agent that catalogues music. 

---

For each of the above systems, I want this repository to build models of my interests. 

So like for movies, I should be able to browse through a gallery view and search over
all the movies of history. The system doesn't need to actually have all videos on disk,
it can have a database of the metadata so I can browse freely. There might be millions of
movies, but I may only have interest in a few thousand. So the system needs to have good
pathways for relevance realization. For example, exceptionally good and blazingly fast
search with relevance realization built in, so I can easily find movies that I'm vaguely
thinking about, or browse movies that I might be interested in from a particular time period.

It should be really easy to find movies that I'm interested in, and discover new movies that
I really like. Same with music, and photos, and books, and documents. I like the idea of the images
saving like an 8 bit looking version for saving disk space, or like having tiers, so like I can imagine
data across the system being lazy loaded. So we save minimal information by default, but as relevance
of items increases, we might prefetch certain information or save certain information, so it's like a lazy
loaded relevance realization system across all data that has ever been created by humanity.

I'm excited to fine craft the awareness plugin to have a closer relationship
with it. 

I'm excited to start working with persistent agent personas rather than just
the ephemeral ones that we have been registering via the statusline work. I'm
excited to bridge those worlds, the logging, statusline world, and the agent
agent, awareness, agentnet, messages, transcripts, voice plugins. 

I'm interested also in indexing all of the prompt templates that we have
throughout this repository and deeply reflecting on our approach to prompt
engineering and agent development. Agents are essentially collections of
prompts, models, and contexts. Prompt templates get injected with context. 

I'm wondering, what are the pathways to really turn up the juice on this
repository in terms of having agents run longer, in more efficient ways, with
clearer directives, and using less tokens, and costing less, while maximizing]
productivity. I think having a really good orchestration process is going to be 
key. I'm excited to work with the awareness plugin to cultivate that in this
repository. 

Processes are so powerful. I love the feature dev plugin and I love the plugin
dev plugin. This is the power of plugins, reliable, functional, repeatable
behavior at your fingertips any time you need it. Plugins are the pathway to
mastering compute.
