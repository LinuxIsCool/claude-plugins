OK the voice plugin is under development. 

---

I need to train my mentor up.

Got to get them on the backlog, get them comprehending all aspects of this
repository. Have then be the yang to the explorer's yin. 

Awareness needs to learn how to properly digest all the logs, all the planning
docs, all the journal entries, all the plugins, all the commits.

So much potential for this repository. Turning agents into eliza agents. Giving
them retrieval over historical conversations. Having differentiated agents in
claude. Having agent to agent communication facilitated via the messaging plugin.
Having comprehensive search across all my messaging platforms. Making full
use of the backlog plugin.

I think that might be a next major step for me. Full utilization of the backlog
plugin, with full vector search over backlog items.
