Good morning. 

I'm so inspired by the potential of what's being created here.

I'm excited again for the voice plugin that we are yet to build.

The voice plugin can be fully compatible with the transcription
and the messages plugins and the search and the awareness plugins.

I want to have a system that can read an ebook or a pdf to me on
demand. Preferably even over the web. I'm looking forward to having
a voice agent that I can have two way dialogue with. I'm sure I
can build that out using huggingface models. 

I want to create the ears of my platform. So I need a program that
runs in the background and processes everything I say. That input
then needs to be appropriately parsed and indexed and dispatched
to the appropriate locations such as to drive navigation of tmux
and to input text into a particular claude. 

I want to be able to navigate tmux using my voice. And input instructions
into a claude instance using my voice and submit that information using my
voice. I want claude to speak to me via hooks.

I want integration with our approach to agents. So that a given claude instance
maps to a given agent. Each agent has a particular voice. 

I'm trying to think through the infrastructure that's needed:
* Background process that listens to everything I say
* Processing of that input in relation to tmux, switch panes / windows / sessions and split panes / create windows / delete panes and windows etc.
* Ability to stream VTT into the claude input field as I'm talking
* Ability to submit to claude
* Claude optionally responds to me on each hook.
* Some notion of agents mapping to voices compatible with our plugin ecosystem
* Robust infrastructure for VTT and TTS with multiple backends, exploring the best of huggingface, ellevenlabs, and local

This plugin should reference the architecture of the messages plugin, the transcription plugin,
the logging plugin for hook usage, and be contextually aware of the current state and future intentions
of this repo such as intentions with the orchestrator agent and agent messaging and social media.
Listening in on voice conversations between agents is going to be amazing.
