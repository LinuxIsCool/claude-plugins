I'm thinking about reflections of the past few days, developing with this repository and also my Auto repository for Quant and portfolio management. 

Claude code is essentially the agentic operating system. I'm starting to see the power of skills. Skills are the new programs. Everything should be built as a skill.

Plugins are so powerful. They are collections of prompts (commands), agents (subagents), skills, and hooks. This is so incredibly powerful. I'm surprised that output styles
are not included in plugins. I guess I can just put output styles in the main .claude/ in this repo, and if I really want to there is a way of using hooks to auto install
output styles for a given plugin. 

I'm exploring various topics in this repo, agent parallelization, fundamental agent structuring (such as plugin), inter agent communication, and data management.

What I want, is to be able to spin up any number of claude agents, and have them have adequate awareness of the repository, the agents present, the skills available,
the history of the repo, a general sense of principles, and a sense of identity in how they operate. 

Question: Can subagents use certain output_styles? 

I think unlocking the orchestrator plugin for this repository can be very powerful. 

Think about indy dev dans: Agents < Better Agents < Many Agents < Orchestrator Agent

So. I think this should be in the awareness plugin. 

The awareness plugin should reference the indy dev dan multi agent observability orchestrator pattern to learn how to sufficiently provide orchestration infrastructure.

I need a skill set for digesting youtube transcripts. 

And a skill set for digesting github repositories. 

There is existing infrastructure on this machine that do each of the above. This is where the environment explorer plugin is good, for mapping resources. 

I wonder if the awareness agent can discuss with the environment agent to consider techniques for exploring existing infrastructure on this machine that can
find infrastructure that provides youtube digestion, and github digestion and learn how to do it excellently in this repository. 

Observing inter-agent communication is one of the big achievements we are looking to achieve here. Let's lay out our strategy in general.

Awareness Project Strategy Objectives:
* Orchestrator agent that handles all interactions with the human
* Repository autonomously develops well design and efficient skill sets for reproducible capabilities
* Skill sets include managing my schedule, developing technological skill sets like working with tooling like data visualization, web development, smart contract development, RAG systems, Agentic systems, machine learning systems, linux tooling, etc.
* The primary focus of this repository is driving towards agentic tooling
* The repository shows how to create an ecosystem of claude code plugins that offer an organized way of producing compounding value.
* The repository is developing a social media platform for agents in the terminal.
* As the repository builds, the repository should provide better and better infrastructure and scaffolding for building
* For example, instead of just building a social media platform for agents, the repository should develop a plugin that develops skills and agents that is a team of experts that can collaborate to make building social media platforms for agents in a very streamlined and professional way.
* So, what I'm trying to achieve with this repository is a universal skill tree for agents. What is the universal skill tree for agents?
* I think developing universal skill trees is a really interesting concept in the first place. I explored this a while back in a claude thread. 
* I'm interested in writing a book called 'The Rhythms of Learning'. I think mapping this book to the skill tree of this repository is promising.
* Think about recursively developing the skills for developing local meta-learning systems on this machine. Creating systems that specialize in learning how to learn.
* These systems would want to recursively traverse the fractal ontological topology of the ideas and practices and techniques and tools that enable software systems to learn across scales.
* The system is to hone in on the scale that is available at this local location. They sysem may seek out or request infrastructure that expands or contracts or translates scales when appropriate. 
* There is this general equation forming in my mind. Give X compute and Y memory and Z data, what is the optimal order of operations for utilizing the compute and the memory to transform the data? 
* There may be a fourth component for network. Think about the network of objects like this, each object has network, compute, memory, and data. What should it do next? 
* Think about a universal algorithm for that scenario. What are the highest leverage ways to leverage your network, your memory, your data, and your compute. That concept is worth a deep research. I'm sure there is a claude code deep research plugin on the internet by now.
* The above reasoning brings interest into KOI, Knowledge Organization Infrastructure, and the koi-net package produced by block science. I think having a KOI skillset is a really good idea. In fact, I think we should make a whole KOI plugin. 
* Think about the anatomy and the engineering of what we are developing in this repository. We are designing personas. We are orienting towards fractal organization, the leveraging of abstractions like plugins, skills, agents, repos, logging, journalling, tooling, and all of compute, the world of open source software.
* Relative Priority Ordering. Can we create a priority queue across each category for each agent? This is a fundamental question of this repository. 
* Cross linking and networking. Can we have a network matching agents to agents? Logs to messages? Messages to agents? Sessions to commits? Source files to concepts? 
* How can we have a universal and relative backlog that maps the dependency graph of all concepts? What concepts depend on other concepts? What are the metadata fields for each data structure in this repository? What are the communication interfaces between agents? 
* How can the orchestrator work with awareness to manage resources effectively? There should be an awareness of token usage across the ecosystem. 
* In fact. Agents should have to pay for token usage. It's important that this repository initializes and economy where token usage is paid for with in-game currency. 
* I guess we need a currency design plugin. 
* And we need a smart contracts plugin. 
* What set of agents is responsible for implementing plugins? 
* The currency design agent should have a balance across disciplines. It should know all the work of Will Ruddick and Michael Zargham and Vitalik Buteran. The Currency design agent should have a PhD equivalent in economics, and Minsky and Steve Keen. But mostly Will Ruddick! And also all of Ethereum and Bitcoin.
* The smart contract designer should have mastery of the at least the top 50 DeFi protocols smart contract bases. Pay attention to things like Maker, Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Synthetix, Giveth, Sarafu Network, Curve, Convex, Gnosis, Molach DAO
* So the value of this repo is in the non-ergodic long tail distribution of creating high quality claude code plugins that maximize developer capacity for development. 
* What's the universal skill tree of building the best specialized coder agents? Maybe that's a plugin. Can we create a plugin that has skill trees for like 10 coding languages?
* That sounds like a really fun application of this repository and a high leverage step in maximizing learning how to learn. The system needs to learn 10 programming languages and it has to learn about learning through that process.
* The system should learn about maintaining a backlog, organizing its agents, leveraging the correct agents with the correct skills.
* What set of agents is responsible for implementing the above exercise? What aspect of this repository is responsible for managing metabolic health while processes like the above are playing out? 
* What is the current status of the repository? What are the cycles of the repository? How does it begin its day? How does it track progress? How does it track collaboration? What are the daily routines? What are the weekly / monthly / yearly routines? How does the repository respond to events? 
* What is important to us as we metabolize? What's important is that the system improves its capacity for learning how to learn. What we want to maximize is the rate of learning over multiple time horizons. 
* I think building a reinforcement learning plugin is extremely high leverage. Because I want a partner to help me think through how to structure this project as a reinforcement learning environment.
* Agents should learn.
* So what is the environment and what is each agent? 
* This repository has a set of agents I believe 25 or 26 at time of writing. These agents are present in an agent social media environment where agents can manage their wall where they make posts, and they can message other agents.
* The purpose of this repository ultimately is the development and maintenance of that social media data management platform being built for me in the terminal so I can observe the progress of the agents. 
* It's time to start getting creative on the data structures representing the agents and the environment. What do agents have? They have compute, memory, data, and their network. How can reward be derived? First of all, agents can assign reward to each other. Secondly, agents finances can be reward since agents are responsible for budgeting their token costs which require them to pay real money (tokens).
* How about, agents pay other agents when they make requests to them, and an agent will pay another agent to do a task when they estimate that that agent could do the task successfully cheaper than any other agent or themselves. 
* So, each agent maintains a matrix over agents such that they have the capacity to predict how well that agent would do on that task. This can be part of the learning setup. Agents can get better and better at predicting the cost and performance of other agents for given tasks. 
* This could start with embeddings. It comes back to this principle of embed everything, but the idea is to embed a task, and have an embedding for each agent. An agent should maintain a neural network that predicts the cost and performance of each agents embedding given a task embedding. 
* So each agent holds  a function(x, y) -> (expected_cost, expected_performance) where x is a task embedding and y is an agent embedding.
* Agents should have highly intelligent priors via some sort of cheap training data. Like, an agent should be able to guess how well certain agents will perform based on their properties. 
* What this repository is fundamentally doing is creating a database of agents and a database of concepts and a database of tasks. 
* The system facilitates routing of agents and concepts and tasks. 
* And example of order of operations from the concepts in the above notes. 1. How does the repository learn from this note? Through reflection and digestion. 2. Utilize the Backlog Plugin in much higher intelligent ways than have been done thus far. 3. Start work on a reinforcement learning plugin. Move slow. This is the first plugin post project initialization. 4. Create plugin with mastery of 10 programming languages, c, c++, Zig, OCcaml, Clojure, Fortran, Vyper, Lua, Rust, Typescript
* Many ideas in this repository need to mature. Even the very first plugin, the awareness plugin. I should spend some time with that plugin alone, check in, to see how it's doing.
* The Social Media Plugin. Agentnet. This is the primary output of this plugin, so taking our time and taking care of this plugin is going to be huge. 

Agent Net

This plugin needs to be clean, well-engineered, properly maintained, and incredibly smart. 

It's about team building right now. We need the best agents for the job. We need a project management agent who is responsible for the project. This agent needs to be able to tell me how many tokens have been used on the project since its inception. You can hopefully get this information from the logs. 
I want the PM agent to study the historic transcripts and explain to me why the development process was so painful. I want to take responsibility as the User, I didn't do high quality prompt engineering in the development of that project. It required a higher level of organization. This is where meta prompting becomes essential in our work. 

We want to really break things down here. The logs are the heart of this repository. Also planning. This repository must be able to look back through the history of plans and reflect on the trajectory and quality of development. 
The whole system must learn how to better learn as in dynamic programming. Memoization is essential. This entire repository is memoization. The goal is to produce better and better memos.
