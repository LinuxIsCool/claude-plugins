Additionally, the other feature I had in mind is to modify the [Agent:ID] part so that it's color is dependent on its status, like if it's currently working it should be this blue color that it is now, but if it's idle it should be the same color as the model beside it (that yellow). Use the hooks as intelligently as possible. Consult with the plugin dev plugin. ultrathink with awareness.
