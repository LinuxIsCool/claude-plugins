I'm going to use this marketplace to build out compounding functionality in
claude code in a clean modular way. Some ideas for plugins include:
* Brainstorm [Implemented]
* Logging [Implemented]
* Schedule [Implemented]
* Awareness
* Backlog
* Voice
* Statusline
* Memory
* Knowledge Graphs
* Agents


## Brainstorm

This plugin gives claude a structured approach to collaborative brainstorming.

## Logging

This plugin enables logging of events in claude code.

## Schedule

This plugin enables management of a local scheduling system. Architecture is inspired by Backlog.md.

## Awareness

This plugin gives claude additional self awareness and self reflection.

Thinking about this plugin. I want to give claude advanced understanding of
itself. This plugin will come with skills for exploring developments in claude
code such as reading the documents, utilizing the claude guide subagent, and
having pre-existing references to claude code workflows and advanced techniques.
