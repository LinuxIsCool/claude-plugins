I need a way of organizing all my claude tmux panes that I have open. Working
on that with the interfaces plugin. I lost track of what all these current
agents are working on. There was an agent working on the statusline and I can't
find it. There was also an agent working on the obsidian plugin and I'm not
seeing that one either. Also, the agent working on automatic branching, i'm not
seeing that one either. 

I want to get the statusline information on point. Getting a really strong and
persistent agent name, a description of what the agent is working on, and a
description of what the agent is working on right now. With really descriptive,
specific, semantically dense descriptions.

Claude agents should have a save and quit command.  like /wq would be really cool. 

Journal entries should be written in the background using either a subagent or claude headless. 

I want application development urls to be in the statusline.

OK so we are reaching a new level of development. We are doing agentic interface design.

We have Decided that an agent should have the following properties:

* Name
* ID
* Description
* Summary
* Model
* Directory
* Context
* Cost
* Project (Project Agent Number)
* Session Number
* Prompt Number
* Start Time
* Branch Status
* Tags

Additional properties that I'm thinking about:

    * creator
    * commit history
    * pane number

So right now we have the UI:

    [Name:ID] model | directory | context | cost | project | session number | prompt number | start time | branch status 
    description: summary | tags

I'm thinking about adding bellow that:

    commit history

I'm also thinking about adding tmux pane number

    description: summary | tmux pane number | tags
