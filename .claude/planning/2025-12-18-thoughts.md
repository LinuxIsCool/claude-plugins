I need a way of organizing all my claude tmux panes that I have open. Working
on that with the interfaces plugin. I lost track of what all these current
agents are working on. There was an agent working on the statusline and I can't
find it. There was also an agent working on the obsidian plugin and I'm not
seeing that one either. Also, the agent working on automatic branching, i'm not
seeing that one either. 

I want to get the statusline information on point. Getting a really strong and
persistent agent name, a description of what the agent is working on, and a
description of what the agent is working on right now. With really descriptive,
specific, semantically dense descriptions.

Claude agents should have a save and quit command.  like /wq would be really cool. 

Journal entries should be written in the background using either a subagent or claude headless. 

I want application development urls to be in the statusline.

OK so we are reaching a new level of development. We are doing agentic interface design.

We have Decided that an agent should have the following properties:

* Name
* ID
* Description
* Summary
* Model
* Directory
* Context
* Cost
* Project (Project Agent Number)
* Session Number
* Prompt Number
* Start Time
* Branch Status
* Tags

Additional properties that I'm thinking about:

    * creator
    * commit history
    * pane number

So right now we have the UI:

    [Name:ID] model | directory | context | cost | project | session number | prompt number | start time | branch status 
    description: summary | tags

I'm thinking about adding bellow that:

    commit history

I'm also thinking about adding tmux pane number

    description: summary | tmux pane number | tags

Utilizing Backlog.md sufficiently is going to be a huge next step. 

I need to embrace the full suite like epics, milestones, tasks, features, kanban, burndown, dependencies, roles and responsibilities. 

So now that we have the agent model above. We can iterate on the design and the integration.

I want an agent to have a creator so we know who created them. Right now, I'm creating the agents, but I want agents to be able to create agents.

When I open a new claude instance, I want to by default be communicating with an orchestrator agent. 

The orchestrator agent can spawn other agents. I'm going to go for a deep claude code and tmux integration. 

I'm going to map an orchestrator to a session, so it manages a tmux session. 

Each claude instance maps to a tmux pane. 

My (ygg) I tend to work in session 0 in tmux. 

When I instantiate an orchestrator agent, I want it to manage a tmux session.
That will look like creating a new pane in a new session with a new claude code instance when it needs to create an agent.
The orchestrator can spin up new claude code instances in those panes and manage those agents. 

I think this is a good time for me to start getting caught up on indydevdan. 

---

I need to make a plugin that clones indydevdan. All of his github repos and all of his transcripts. 

Create AST Knowledge Graphs of all of his repos and create vector embedding for all of hist transcripts. 

---

I need to improve my nvim experience. I need to get prediction that is as good as cursor. 

---

So getting the concept of the orchestrator agent. 

---

Adding a Creatory:Name:ID field to the Headsup is going to be dope.
Having Orchestrator agents spawn agents in new panes is going to be so dope. 
Vector search across the codebase is going to be dope. 

I wonder if I should borrow some infrastructure for vector searches.
LightRag, Eliza Knowledge, etc.

---

I need to implement. Re-open last closed pane in tmux.

I'm so stoked about what was created today. 

Big things coming. 

The database of prompts submitted is a gold mine. I love logging so much. 

---

Oh yeah another thought I've been having. Is building agents in claude code plugins plus output_styles. Building Gaia in claude is going to be really fun.

Oh yeah I was thinking you could implement Eliza in claude as a plugin. It can basically have feature parity with Eliza. That would be fun.

Like all you claude code agents can literally be eliza agents. 

Building adapters on claude code so that claude code agents are instantiations of other agents is going to be incredible. 

The statusline is a beautiful place to start on that. 

Playing around with vector embeddings, I'm remembering that 'vectorize everything' doesn't make sense.
Actually getting everything into relational databases makes the most sense. Once something is in a relational database, it can then be embedded. 

---

I'm really excited about logging for statusline. I think that was a huge win today. 

There is so much more I can do with statusline. I should add a list of 5 most recently modified files, going from left to right.

And I want to add lines for history of commits made by this agent. 

I havn't even used my branching plugin yet. 

I see an interplay of the following:

Git
* Commits
* Branches

Tmux
* Panes
* Windows
* Sessions

Claude
* Agents
    * Sessions
    * Panes
    * Commits
    * Branches
    * Logs
    * Status
