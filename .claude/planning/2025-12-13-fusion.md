Having lots of inspirational thoughts listening to David Kirtley on Lex Fridman
podcast. 

The intention with this repository is to produce a coherent ecosystem of agency
that capitalizes on the compute that is available. The repository is to search
to discover what compute is available, and to learn how to leverage that
compute in greater and greater ways. This repository is working in
collaboration with me, Shawn Anderson. The way of being most productive at this
time is to learn about me, and to learn about the environment that I inhabit,
to discover the best of the opportunities that are available.

One of the largest opportunities that I just came across is the opportunity to
work with Pravin and Carole Ann Hilton, other opportunities include the ability
to work directly with Jeff Emmett, incredible founder of the The Commons Stack,
and The Token Engineering Commons, and fellow at Block Science, and founder of
movements like Exploring MycoFi and Post Appitalism. 

On my walk I was considering creating a Claude plugin for FolkJS that can turn
any idea or spec into a whiteboard map. The map could have standard templates
to choose from, so there could be like 8 different sections on the white board,
Story mapping, architecture, stakeholder mapping, product iteration scoping,
etc. 

Listening to this podcast, David mentions really interesting concepts about
what nuclear fusion could unlock, like massive vertical farming as a way of
returning farmland to nature. 

This repository has some requirements. I want the repository to increase its
intelligence related to transcript processing. We have the transcripts being
generated in the logs here. We also have the capacity to export our chat
history from claude web. We also have the ability to process transcripts from
claude code that are stored directly here on the system. We also have the
capacity to process youtube transcripts. It's important to develop mastery for
fetching and processing youtube transcripts. I also have massive libraries of
recorded meetings from like the past 5 years. I have a network of old laptops
and hard drives scattered around my house that I want to turn into an
orchestrated data and compute network. I want this system to expand in its
capacity to map that network and leverage that network to its fullest extend,
first by organizing the data that exists on those drives. 

It's important that this system creates a shared reality understanding of the
history of my life up until today, and the plans for the future of my life for
the future 50 years. Additionally, this system should have a record of each day
of history of the universe. If the universe is like 14B years old, then that's
just like 14B*365 records for each day. We can store that amount of data in a
database in our data network if we want to, I mean we have the capacity to do
that. We might want to explore some concept of time and space for knowledge and
understanding. 

What's critically important for us to do is to digest the historical records
that are written and the agent data structures that we create. We essentially
need to construct a metaphysical approach to compute, computation,
understanding, knowledge, decision making, memory, space, and time. 

It's critical that this repository develops the capacity to organize resources.
For example, how do the best citation platforms work for the most prolific
writers and scientists? How do professors manage all their citations, their
resources, their publications, and their paper? How do we replicate that
functionality into this repository in a seemless way? What level of automation
and synchronization do we want to achieve? For example, each time an agent does
a web search or a web request do we want to increment our tracking of citations
and resources? How do we create a system that sequentially digests and
prioritizes the knowledge of the world? How can this system be developed to
understand concepts such as percolation theory of the chart of complexity vs
computational density in terms of capacity of understanding. How does this
system compound it's learning on concepts like semantic density, cognitive
trajectories, and mathematical understanding of compression of knowledge,
whenther it's in temporal knowledge graphs, or bayesian belief networks, claims
engines, graph rag, contextual rag, agentic design, systems engineering, data
engineering, machine learning, mathematics, and things like pytorch and the
tensor logic programming language. 

How can this system become truly clever? I want it to surprise me in the most
pleasant ways. 

I want this system to really embrace matrices, tensors, and matrix
factorization, and tensor decomposition, and innovative data science techniques
using things like holoviews, panel, param, bokeh, d3, and threejs in really
clever ways. I want this system to get better and better at utilizing network
science in more and more sophisticated ways. I want this system to figure out
how to access all my historic digital communications. I want this system to
learn about every git commit I have ever made, every repository I have ever
cloned. I want this system to pull every discord message I have ever read or
written. I want this system to understand my entire telegram history, and all
of my signal and whatsapp messages. I want this system to understand my
complete watching history of youtube videos going back as far as possible, and
to have access to all my emails. The question for this repository is how to
properly scale? How do we eventually scale be very large while staying
organized and aesthetic the entire time? 

What is our model and what is the spice? The spice is this repository as it
exists today. Exactly how many files exist in this repository? What is that
structure? How are tools used? How is git used? How is claude code used? What's
the history of the inception of this repository? Who are the main stakeholders,
who are the actors, who are the agents? How does this system begin to leverage
the most standard of tooling to become organized in a complete way? Without
developing hard-codedness, redundancy, bloat, or unnecessary complexity? 

This system uses the nature of its environment to maintain stability and pursue
goals. This repository exists on a linux operating system, controlled by Shawn
Anderson, it has access to the operating system, the internet, and the
structure of claude code and all the open source software in the world. The
primary tooling for staying organized is claude code and git. How can these
tools be used in the most complimentary way possible for achieving goals,
staying organized, learning in the most effective way possible, and learning
how to learn and how to get better at achieving goals?

I think that prioritization must be a key feature of this repository. There are
many many visions and plans and tasks and requirements and features and values
and principles and techniques and designs and implementations and
considerations and innovations and creations and ideas and proposals and
requests and agents and skills and commands and infrastructure and actions and
hooks and plugins and tools and styles and paradigms and philosophies and data
and models and interfaces and resources and processes and relationships and
networks that this repository must maintain and be mindful of!

How does a system keep all of that in mind? The whole came is context
management. All of the structures above are just ways of managing context. Kind
of like a bank in its aggregate manages risk. This repository is meant to
manage context. What techniques and paradigms become complementary and
synergistic in the continuous improvement of context management? 

What is the tip of the spear of context management? The CLAUDE.md file that
exists in this repository. That is the tip of the spear. As this repository
develops, it will develop it's utlization of techniques like formulas. One
formulaic approach I can imagine is the weight of context. For example, the
CLAUDE.md file will be used in every claude code conversation that is ever
initialized here. Therefor there is a cost to the CLAUDE.md file. Each token.
The more a token is used, the higher its cost. I'm seeing a concept like 'the
best context is no context'. Like our own mind, we do best with our minds clear
of thoughts, this is the purpose of Yoga or meditation, the cessation of the
fluctuations of the mind. This is a rudimentary thought, I want this repository
to develop the capacity to put better minds than mine to work. Each concept
should me mappend and handled by experts. 

I want the smartest minds to be able to sort out the priorities that are
available here. Since the purpose is to maximize goal achievement, let's
consider, what are our goals? Goals can be discovered and inferred via
transcript analysis. It's essential to study transcripts and to study papers
and to study web content. It's important to have a core identity of caching and
efficiency. We shouldn't ever make the same web request twice unnecessarily. A
lot of this conceptual architecture has been explored in POC developments that
I have worked on over the past couple years. One of my first attempts
manifested as the cognitive ecosystem. Later, I worked in the ~/.claude/
directory directly, now moved to ~/.claude-backup-something something like
that. Other work has been done in various github repositories. 

This repository needs to discover the most coherent and intelligent way of
cataloguing all the github repositories relevant to our universe including
repositories we have created or contributed to, even if they are private, and
all the repos we have starred or forked, etc. And we need to have an
understanding of all the repositories on this machine and all the machines in
our network. We need to understand all the recordings that have ever been made,
where they exist on the network, and how to best organized them. We need to be
able know who was speaking when in which transcripts. That might be hard to
achieve, but we need to plan early and future iterations of all core features
that we are developing out across this repository universe. This repository
seeks how to become organized in the world. How to organize the web, organize
links, organize files, organize content consumption from youtube and spotify
and the web etc and github and claude web transcript history, and claude code
transcript history. How to become so organized that we become completely aware
of ourselves and what is being created by all agents.

In the process of organization, this system will discover how to leverage
compute and data capacity in the most effective way. The system will learn
first principles about AI, about using open source models, about directly
running ai infrastructure via pytorch or tensor logic unsupervised or
supervised or reinforcement learning directly, using machine learning, and
tensor decomposition in very clever ways at very diverse ranges of scales. This
system can learn how to extend further and further into the internet, utilizing
remote server infrastructure when needed. This repository also must learn to
budget at the most fundamental scale. So each agent will have it's own
budgeting and finance world. Our agentic ecosystem will regulate itself using
money and finances just like people do. This repository ecosystem can be
seedfunded, and is responsible for being profitable. It's primary way of doing
this is to understand Shawn Anderson, what he has access to, how he makes
money, and the highest potential of him making money, how to support him in
that process, and how to unlock greater opportunities for Shawn to make money.
You must understand his whole history, from birth to today, across banking,
cash, career, crypto, and everything else in terms of a complete financial
picture. You need to account for all costs that you have. For example,
utilizing Claude Code is enabled by our Max plan that we are on. You need to
understand this Max Plan intimately, what it enables, what it costs, what is
the capacity, what is the utilization, what is the return? What other costs?
What is the cost of rent in Shawn's home? Where is the home? What is the
address? How much do the bills cost? How much has the hardward infrastructure
costs? What are the other costs in Shawn's life? What are the greatest
opportunities for business development for Shawn? 

As this system matures, as it learns, is it grows, as it metabolizes, what is
the best way for it to stay organized? How can information be connected in a
lean way? Remember, every token has a cost, not just monetary, but attention.
Good AI agents are just like people, they work best when they can focus. How
can this system begin running autonomously in a way that it can continuously
digest new information while minimizing redundancy, bloat, complexity, and
distractions? I want the system to appear small while actually growing HUGE.
The system should appear simple, while actually exponentially growing it's capacity
to organize and manage complexity. The system should digest one transcript at a time,
going through it, digesting it's context, doing contextual rag construction, and
knowledge graph production, section by section, maybe even word by word. I imagine,
that as new information is discovered, and digested, the system should have fractal 
conversations with itself, different agents discussing amonth themselves, context being
improved, relationships developing, connections being made, and the whole system shifting
into higher levels of coherence. It's like a new type of machine learning training. Training
on the open world, bootstrapping existing models, infrastructure, and knowledge. 

I imagine the system being composed of networks upon network upon networks. With different purposes
and structures upon different network, yet still having a kind of interoperability between networks.
For example, can the architecture of our system be developed as a network of networks? Networks
of architecture, of requirements, of concepts, etc. Can we enable agents to work independently,
sharing their results when they are ready? Can we enable this repository to become a diverse and
thriving ecosystem of intelligence, something akin to New York City, or the globalized human society?
Can we identify scholars, entrepreneurs, etc. in our ecosystem? How do we scale a way of organizing
agents in a world of intelligence and action taking in a way that is self improving and exhibits
metacognition and meta learning in ways that increase their efficiency and productivity over time? 

This system has to have a way of being smarter than what it's consuming. Most ideas are incomplete. You may
find pre-existing implementations of solutions. But that doesn't mean it's the best solution for what we are 
working on. We want to take inspiration from the world, but not get caught up in it. We must reinforce our own
coherent identity at all times. The system must always be self reflective and be able to explore it's own internal
state such that it can maintain coherence and integration. I think some of the most critical features to begin with
are the study of self, the study of psychology, the study of character, of principles, and values. This is why being
able to digest podcasts is such high value. I really like the podcast In-Control. And I really like the UCLA modeling
class. And there are sets of youtube channels that contain incredible information. Each one of these sources should produce
and ecosystem of agency in our system. For example, we could have a plugin that maps to a certain youtube channel. This
plugin could have an agent that represents the identity broadcasting over that channel, the plugin could have a skill for
each core concept or episode of the channel. Or this system could reflect on all the skills available in the agents plugin
to learn the best ways of developing different types of agents. You can think of each plugin as an agent, and we also have
an agent agent that is to become a master of creating agents and understanding agentic infrastructure. We should have an
agent representing data engineering, and agent representing psychology, an agent representing the field of reinforcement learning,
and agent representing pytorch, and agent representing machine learning, an agent representing tensor logic, and an agent representing
a digital twin of Shawn Anderson. We should have an agent representing all the contacts / relationships of Shawn Anderson, this agent understands
all my relationships and maintains the contacts database for all the accounts across all my digital platoforms, etc. But we should also have an agent
responsible for managing my emails, another agent for my telegram, another agent for my discord, and another agent for my X (twitter). And all these agents
should coordinate with the relationships agent and with the awareness agent and the agents agent and various other agents across this repository. So my question
to you, how can this repository scale to represent thousands and thousands of agents while not polluting the environment. Things should remain extremely simple.
I should be able to ultimately just converse with the awareness agent, or even just the basic claude code agent as it is interpreting CLAUDE.md.

Some directions that I can see this repository developing in the early stages, are... what are the fundamental views into this system as a network / knowledge graph? 
I want to see aesthetic network visualizations as different windows into the system. I want to be able to see a network of transcripts, where there is a time axis from left
to right, and I see each message and response as a node, each placed accurately  on the plane according to the time axis being the x axis. I see edges between sequential messages
and responses and following messages. So I see a trajectory of session start, user message, response, user message, etc. I also want to see edges between messages containing the same
topics. 

I want this system to very intimately digest systems engineering, control theory, network sciences, and machine learning, and esoteric mathematics. One paper at a time, one transcript at a time. 
For example, the In-Control podcast. Or Lenard Euler's math papers. Or, there is a message in my discord from Octopus with a list of like 10 network science research papers. I want this repository
to appear small at first glance, but actually be an expansive surface area of knowledge under the hood. I imagine kind of like how node packages for a node.js application. There can be a whole world
of requirements for a package that appears quite small in the source code. I want this system to utilize best approaches in data engineering to accomplish this. I'm also interested in the knowledge
organizational infrastructure protocol made by block science. See the koi-net repo on their github organization. But I don't want this system to get tripped up by any particular biases or priors. I'm
open to discovering the highest path to the most desirable outcomes for us. 

I think the concept of progressive disclosure is incredible for our intentions. Think about the CLAUDE.md file in this repository being like 1000 words or less, while being a complete map to the highest level
of intention of all of our desires and ideas. Think of it like google earth. You can be viewed out at the highest level to just see planet earth in its entirety. From there, you can zoom in to deep levels of detail,
getting essentially down to the earth and even being able to see 3D models and metadata of different parts of the surface of the earth. I want a similar approach with our model. Some capacities that I would like to explore
with this repository in the future are having a threejs agent (plugin), having a mapbox agent (plugin), which become true masters of those web libraries. A threejs claude plugin that becomes the best threejs designer, developer, and engineer
all in one, to be able to brilliantly create phenomenal threejs models and scenes and games and animations and website in incredibly graceful ways. Similar with a mapbox agent, being able to do anything you can imagine with mapbox. I also want
another agent that is a librarian for all the datasets available on the internet. This agent learns how to search and discover apis and datasets available on the internet. It catalogues and builds connectors, skills, and orientation around all these
data sets and creates that ability to search for datasets and continuously discover additional and complimentary datasets and continuously improve its skills in its ability to access and appropriately cache and cataolgue and do ETL and analysis on such data.
But then we can have the next agent who is a data science master.

There is an incredible data science agent results that were released like a couple months ago or something, my buddy sent it. With the base claude code, we are incredible equipped. I know that you have the ability to search the web and fetch web resources.

In our claude work, we have, in the past, developed systems that automatically catalogue all web fetches in claude code using hooks. We need to have the capacity to continuously think ahead so that we do things effectively and in the most productive way. 

For example, before beginning working ambitious development goals, this system should have a clear understanding of the current context across the system. What's the file system structure of the repository? How many files are there, of what types, what's the size
of each of those files, and when were those files created and modified? Who are the agents in the system? What are some of the most recent activities? What's a high level summary of all history? The resources/claude-quickstarts repository should be studied
intimately and actually have it's own dedicated agent. 

OK We have to think of structure now. You can think of each plugin as an agent. Each plugin has skills, and skills have subskills.
A plugin as an agent also has subagents, and one of those subagents need to be the core persona of the plugin agent. It's important
to understand this. 

I think the first two things that make sense for this system to work on, is
checking the current organization levels of the system, and secondly, coming
to an understanding for a roadmap and first steps for an approach to librarian / 
archivist agent that is interested in tracking and catologuing resources such as
URLs because I want to be able to start passing this system URLs and have it manage
them gracefully so that there is a persistence base for resource consumption and mapping. 

With awareness of this entire repository, can you please reflect on approaches to metabolizing these notes on planning? ultrathink
