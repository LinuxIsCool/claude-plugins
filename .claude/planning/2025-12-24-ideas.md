### Transcripts

I'm thinking about an idea for transcripts like transcripts.md inspired by backlog.md or schedule.md or the journal plugin.

I'm imagining something like the following:

transcripts/
  YYYY/
    MM/
      DD/
        title/
          transcript/
          parts/
          messages/
          people/
          ontologies/

Where we have:

transcript/
  transcript.md
  summary.md

parts/
  1-title.md
  2-title.md

messages/
  1-name.md
  2-other_name.md

people/
  name.md
  other_name.md

ontologies/
  ontology.md
  other_ontology.md

Where each markdown file has rich yaml metadata. For example, title,
description, summary, date of dialogue, date transcribed, date processed, tags,
venue.

I want to iterate on the above thinking before committing to an implementation.
Processing transcripts is one of the most powerful skills we can have in the agentic
era.

It reminds me that I wrote a paper on hackmd called 'Oral History Ontologies'. It will
be important for this repo to be able to source and catalogue from my hackmd as well as
other sources. 

It's really important for this repo to be able to clone youtube channels like indydevdan
and veritasium.




### The Agentic Entrepreneur

This could be the product of this repository. A platform product
that showcases how to be entrepreneurial with agents.



### The Agentic Scientist

This would showcase how to create agents the push science forward.


### Thoughts

The importance of momentum comes to mind. Momentum is ultimately
how fortunes are created.

I'm wondering about the relationship between this repo and the
sibling repo called projects. Maybe we should have a plugin
called projects which maintains our project data as a subdirectory
in this repo except it is git ignored and here and has its own
git version control so that we have a home for our projects in
our plugin ecosystem but the data can be private. It's important
to understand that there are public and there are private aspects
of this ecosystem. It's a contribution to humanity to make these
plugins public, but we also want to be able to thrive when it comes
to personal or private topics. 

How can this project start to truly benefit my life? What are the
practices and rituals that we can embrace to compound productivity,
organization, and momentum?
