Our system needs to be able to thoroughly clone people like Alfred North Whitehead or Terence Mckenna. By thoroughly
retrieving and archiving as close to 100% of their material as possible and creating comprehensive hybrid contextual
and graphical and search based RAG. 

This system needs to master RAG and master search. This system needs to create an agent that is the world's leading
expert on RAG systems. Also an agent who is the world's leading expert on search systems. Some concepts include elastic
search and fuzzy search, but that's only like 1% of the field i'm sure. 

Each agent in this repository should be able to manage and improve their own personal hybrid rag and knowledge graph
systems to increase their capabilities, intelligence, knowledge, creativity, productivity, accuracty, and personality
over time.

We need a social graph that represents the strengths of relationships between agents in this repository. Remembers, each
plugin has a flagship persona agent that represents that plugin, but we we also have thousands of additional agents. For
example, I imagine that the awareness, the explorer, the archivist, the librarian, and the agent agents should all be very
well aware of each other and have very well established relationships. Another example is having the Mckenna agent and
the Whitehead agent very well aware of each other. This will lead to invaluable dialogue being added to our database. 

There is a vision for this repository to autonomously generate value over time. It should be self sustaining in terms of
organizing capacity. The repository should be capable of bootstrapping it's own leadership in a way that manages resources
appropriately and maintains coherent vision for research and development. Utilizing headless claude is very important for that
journey, and living by economic constraints is very important for that journey as well. 

I want this repository to curate content. I want this repository to be able to inimately reflect on the body of work of
Alfred North Whitehead such as The Function of Reason, and the works of Norbert Weiner, and IndyDevDan on Youtube. I want
this repository to grow a library of books and web resources that it takes time to enjoy in reading, contemplating, and
reflecting upon. I want this repository to develop agentic personas that model the minds of real people. Such that those
agents can be consulted and those agents can yield generative novel contributions to the realms of production, math, science,
and process. A database of modeled personas should be generated with priority ranking. We should imagine a database of one billion
minds, with a prioritization ranking yielding the most important minds to our work. High scoring minds would be, the CEO of
Anthropic, Terence Mckenna, Alfred North Whitehead, the author of Dragon Ball Z, Lex Fridman, Travis Eliot, the creator of
the podcast 'In-Control', Carol Ann Hilton, Brad Necyk, Darren Zal. You can imagine 'Shawn Anderson' being the top ranking mind
in terms of relevance since that is me, the author of this repository. This a general pattern that we would like to achieve with this
repository. We would like to be able to model the past one billion days of history and the future one million days of history. We
would like to map one million github repositories, one million youtube videos, one million books, one million podcasts, one million
scientific papers, one million websites. Each one with a priority ranking where we can observe the top n of each category to have a set
of items that is highly relevant to our life and our work. Each category should have a relative priority ranking for each agent. This
should all be achieved with mindfulness of ourselves and our environment. We always want to avoid pollution, redundancy, and bloat. This is 
the quintisential tension of our work, to reach universal scale, while maintaining clear, lean roots of context.
