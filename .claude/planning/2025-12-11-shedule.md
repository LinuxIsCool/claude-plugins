Okay, so I'm interested in making this app called schedule.md inspired off of the architecture of backlog.md. Imagine you're a student at a university and you're making your weekly schedule and you see in the online application for the university in your schedule builder as you select your classes, you see different color coded blocks for your weekly scheduler.

I really like this interface, so I want to make a schedule.md that has a web interface to a color coded weekly scheduler and I can just talk to Claude and say, hey, how's my schedule look or I want to add this to my schedule or can you pull in this data to augment our schedule. I'm going to access my yoga website to build a yoga schedule. So Claude can help me find my yoga schedule.

Once I have that, I can also, I want to be able to connect to my Google calendar to put an overlay of my Google calendar so I can see my weekly work schedule etc and then I want to be able to schedule in different blocks and have some cool access to summary statistics like how much hours am I spending per week per activity etc and having really cool stuff in the schedule view like I see my yoga classes, I see what class they are, I see my different schedule blocks that I want to add to the scheduler.

See:
@resources/Backlog.md/

Help me scope out the first iteration
of a functional system that can put the
first iteration of my schedule together
and help me view it in the browser.

And here is my yoga studio. I thought there was a way to see the whole calendar but I don't see it now.

Please study the nature of plugins to create
this program as a claude code plugin.

Create a schedule plugin for utilizing claude code to manage 
a schedule. Plan out three phases of this app. Having
the google calendar overlay can come in phase 2. 

After reflecting on the above, pause and reflect on next steps.
