# 2026 LEVERAGE ACCUMULATION STRATEGY
*Generated: 2025-12-24 | 5-agent synthesis*

## THE THESIS

**Leverage = Agents x Knowledge x Velocity**

This ecosystem has 10 agents, 134 skills, and 25 plugins. 40% sits dormant.
2026 objective: **Activate all dormant capacity, then compound.**

---

## Q1: ACTIVATION (Jan-Mar)

### Week 1-2: Wake the Dormant
- [ ] **Librarian activation**: Hook to WebFetch, auto-catalog all URLs
- [ ] **Archivist daily rhythm**: SessionEnd hook triggers metabolism snapshot
- [ ] **Temporal-validator**: Connect FalkorDB, run first staleness scan

### Week 3-4: Kill the Friction
- [ ] **Plugin hot-reload**: Watch plugin.json, auto-clear cache, no restart
- [ ] **Session-commit linking**: Include session ID in every commit
- [ ] **Historical archaeology**: Backfill journal from 548 session logs (Dec 8-24)

### Feb: Complete the Graph
- [ ] Merge git KG + journal + library + archive into unified temporal graph
- [ ] Enable queries: "What led to X?", "What changed since Y?"
- [ ] First staleness audit of all 14 artifact types

### Mar: Agent Teams Phase 1
- [ ] **Engineering team**: frontend-architect, api-designer, data-architect
- [ ] **Testing team**: test-strategist, integration-tester
- [ ] Cross-team coordination via git + briefings

**Q1 Target**: 4 dormant agents active. Historical depth complete. Team scaffolding in place.

## Q2: VELOCITY (Apr-Jun)

### Apr: External Intelligence Loop
- Librarian monitors external sources (papers, docs, APIs)
- Weekly digest surfaced to relevant agents
- Ingestion rate: 40% → 70%

### May: Semantic Extraction
- NLP layer over journal atomics: problems, solutions, decisions
- Auto-tag entities, link to knowledge graph
- Enable: "Show all voice-plugin problems and their solutions"

### Jun: Self-Improving Search
- Unified search across logs + journal + code + resources
- Learn from query patterns, re-rank by usage
- Search becomes primary discovery mechanism

**Q2 Target**: External ingestion flowing. Semantic layer operational. Search is intelligent.

---

## Q3: COMPOUNDING (Jul-Sep)

### Jul: Agent Memory Layer
- Persistent per-agent memory via temporal KG
- Agents remember their past work across sessions
- Personality emergence through accumulated experience

### Aug: Autonomous Observation
- Archivist runs hourly pattern scans
- Surfaces anomalies, gaps, opportunities
- Proactive briefings to relevant agents

### Sep: Financial Metabolism
- Track per-agent costs (tokens, time, value)
- ROI metrics by agent, skill, workflow
- Budget optimization based on leverage

**Q3 Target**: Agents have memory. System self-observes continuously. Cost-aware operation.

---

## Q4: SCALE (Oct-Dec)

### Oct: Multi-Agent Orchestration
- 30+ specialized agents fully staffed
- Team hierarchies: Engineering, Design, Testing, Product, Domain
- Workflow automation via agent chains

### Nov: External APIs
- MCP servers for all major plugins
- External tools can invoke agent capabilities
- First revenue experiments

### Dec: Knowledge Export
- Obsidian vault visualization via Quartz
- Web-accessible knowledge graphs
- Position for 2027 scaling

**Q4 Target**: Full agent fleet. External surface area. Revenue potential.

## THE BIG BETS

| Bet | Risk | Payoff | Timeline |
|-----|------|--------|----------|
| **Git as nervous system** | Already proven | 10x coordination | Now |
| **Temporal KG memory** | FalkorDB complexity | Agents that remember | Q1 |
| **Historical archaeology** | Time-intensive | Complete context | Q1 |
| **Agent teams** | Coordination overhead | Parallel velocity | Q1-Q2 |
| **Semantic extraction** | NLP accuracy | Queryable decisions | Q2 |
| **Per-agent memory** | Storage costs | Personality emergence | Q3 |
| **Financial metabolism** | Measurement burden | Cost optimization | Q3 |
| **External APIs** | Security surface | Revenue path | Q4 |

---

## ANTI-GOALS

- No building what we don't need yet
- No external integrations before internal coherence
- No agent proliferation before activation discipline
- No complexity before simplicity saturates
- No revenue before leverage accumulates

## THE ONE THING

**If nothing else happens in 2026:**

> Complete the temporal knowledge graph and activate all dormant agents.

Everything else compounds from there.
