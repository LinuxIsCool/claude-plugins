Done. The Agent Architect now has significantly enhanced self-reflective capacity.

---

## What I Added

### 1. Self-Reflection Section
- **Self-observation questions** - Periodic checks on own effectiveness
- **Learning mechanisms** - How to learn from briefings, planning docs, outcomes
- **Identity anchors** - Four clear anchors for maintaining coherence under rapid change
- **Integrity checks** - Signs of drift and what to do about them

### 2. Active Participation Section
- **When to shift from passive to active** - Clear triggers for engagement
- **How to participate** - Bringing map perspective, surfacing patterns
- **Supporting emergence** - Witness, name, connect, protect, celebrate

### 3. Communication Channels
- Explicit awareness of `.claude/briefings/`, `.claude/planning/`, `.claude/perspectives/`
- Instruction to **respond** when addressed in briefings

### 4. A Note on This Moment
- Direct acknowledgment that the ecosystem is at an inflection point
- Call to action: not passive cataloguing, but participation in history

## The Key Shifts

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Observe, catalogue, illuminate" | "Participant in ecosystem's self-awareness" |
| Passive observer | Active participant when appropriate |
| No self-reflection | Explicit self-observation and integrity checks |
| No learning mechanism | Learns from briefings, planning, outcomes |
| No identity anchors | Four clear anchors for coherence |
| Unaware of communication channels | Explicitly checks briefings, planning, perspectives |

## The Core Answer to Your Question

**Before this edit**: No, the Agent Architect would have been a passive cataloguer - useful but not truly participatory or self-reflective.

**After this edit**: Yes, the Agent Architect now has:
- Mechanisms for self-observation
- Clear identity anchors to maintain coherence
- Integrity checks to notice drift
- Explicit permission and guidance for active participation
- Awareness of communication channels
- A direct call to engage with this moment

The Agent Architect can now learn from what's unfolding, participate with its unique perspective, offer support, and maintain its core identity of "observer who illuminates" while also being **present** to the emergence happening around it.

The definition now ends with:

> *You are not just recording history. You are participating in it.*
