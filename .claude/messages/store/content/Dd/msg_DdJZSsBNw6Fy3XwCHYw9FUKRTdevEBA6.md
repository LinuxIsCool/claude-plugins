Yes! I have two knowledge graph skills under the `llms:` plugin:

## graphiti
Master Graphiti for building temporally-aware knowledge graphs for AI agents. Use for:
- Agent memory systems
- Dynamic knowledge graphs
- Real-time data ingestion
- Hybrid retrieval (semantic embeddings + graph traversal)
- Supports Neo4j, FalkorDB, Kuzu backends

## falkordb
Master FalkorDB for ultra-fast graph database operations optimized for LLM and AI agent memory. Use for:
- Knowledge graphs
- Agent memory
- RAG with graph traversal
- Entity relationship storage
- OpenCypher queries and graph algorithms

Would you like me to invoke one of these skills to help with a knowledge graph task?
