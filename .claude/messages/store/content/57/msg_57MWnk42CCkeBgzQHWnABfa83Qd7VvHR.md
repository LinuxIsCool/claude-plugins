Done. The journal entry at `.claude/journal/2025/12/13/2025-12-13.md` now documents both sessions' work.

---

## What the Journal Captures

**Session A** (the other session) documented:
- Creating `/reflect-on` command
- Building agent-architect, process-cartographer, temporal-validator
- Establishing the registry structure
- Discovering our librarian and archivist as "pre-existing"

**Session B** (our session) added:
- The fusion synthesis work
- Five core primitives extraction
- Librarian and Archivist definitions
- Agent Architect enhancement
- The insight about Git + conventions as coordination

**The meta-observation:**
The journal entry itself demonstrates emergent inter-session coordination. Two sessions, working in parallel, created complementary pieces. Each discovered the other's work through the filesystem. The journal now holds both perspectives.

The ecosystem now has a daily journal that multiple sessions can contribute to. The journal itself has become a coordination artifact.
