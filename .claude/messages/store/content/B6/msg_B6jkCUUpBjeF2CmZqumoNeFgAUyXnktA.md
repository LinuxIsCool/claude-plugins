Done. The concept graph visualization has been updated with full provenance metadata. When you hover over any node, the tooltip now displays:

**New metadata fields:**
- **Source** - The file path where the concept was introduced
- **Created** - The date the concept was introduced
- **Agent** - The authoring agent (shown as a styled badge)

The visualization is now at **v3 (with provenance)** and includes all 29 concepts with their complete attribution:

| Agent | Concepts Authored |
|-------|-------------------|
| systems-thinker | 5 (Phase Transition, Creation Addiction, Potential/Kinetic Energy, Activation) |
| agent-architect | 10 (Three-Layer Architecture, Plugin-as-Persona, Fleet Management, etc.) |
| archivist | 4 (Semantic Coherence, Dormant Agents, Metabolic Mapping, Coherence Maintenance) |
| fusion-session | 7 (Context as Currency, Progressive Disclosure, Git as Nervous System, etc.) |
| librarian | 2 (Provenance, Zero Redundant Fetches) |
| system | 1 (Master Skill Pattern) |
