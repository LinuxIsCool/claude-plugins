Done. The planning document now captures this emergent pattern.

## Summary: What We Just Discovered

**While we were working on strategy, another agent session created the infrastructure for what we were designing.**

The `backend-architect` and `systems-thinker` already reflected on the fusion document. The Agent Architect exists to catalogue the fleet. The `/reflect-on` command orchestrates multi-persona analysis.

**The key insight:**

```
Git + Conventions > Complex Protocols
```

The PERSONA_SUBAGENTS_STRATEGY.md describes Letta servers, A2A protocol, three-tier memory. But what's **already working** is simpler:

1. Agents write to known locations
2. Other agents read from those locations  
3. Git makes all changes observable
4. The Agent Architect maintains the map

This is more aligned with "appear small while vast" - no heavy infrastructure, just agreements about where things go.

**The Agent Architect is the keystone.** As it matures, it becomes the nervous system - observing, cataloguing, identifying gaps, suggesting connections.

The planning document is now at **v0.4** with:
- 5 core primitives
- Strategy reconciliation
- Emergent communication patterns
- Updated architecture model
