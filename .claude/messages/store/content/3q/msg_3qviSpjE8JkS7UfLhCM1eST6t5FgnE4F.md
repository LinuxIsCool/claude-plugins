## Summary: Git Coordination at the Highest Level

Here's what we've established to embrace git-based coordination across the ecosystem:

### The Hierarchy

```
CLAUDE.md (Constitutional)
    │
    │  "Git is the inter-agent coordination layer."
    │
    ▼
.claude/conventions/coordination.md (Detailed Patterns)
    │
    │  Commit formats, namespaces, observation patterns
    │
    ▼
Agent Architect (Fleet Coherence)
    │
    │  Observes git, maintains registry, detects drift
    │
    ▼
Archivist (Flow Observation)
    │
    │  Primary git consumer, patterns across time
    │
    ▼
All Agents (Convention Followers)
    │
    │  Write to namespace, commit with format, read anywhere
```

### What Now Exists

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` coordination section | Constitutional principle |
| `.claude/conventions/coordination.md` | Full convention specification |
| Agent Architect git section | Active observation responsibilities |
| Archivist git section | Primary flow observer role |
| Atomic journal entry | Historical record of this decision |

### The Core Conventions

1. **Commit format**: `[scope] action: description`
2. **Namespace ownership**: Each agent writes to its space
3. **Observation**: Check `git log` for ecosystem pulse
4. **Surfacing over policing**: Illuminate patterns, don't rigidly enforce

### Why This Works

Instead of building complex infrastructure:
- Git is already persistent, ordered, observable
- The filesystem is already the coordination substrate
- Conventions are lighter than protocols
- Self-correction beats enforcement

### The Ecosystem Self-Awareness Loop

```
Agent acts → Commits with convention → Other agents observe git →
Archivist patterns it → Agent Architect maintains coherence →
Drift surfaces → Ecosystem self-corrects
```

The ecosystem now has **conscious awareness** of its own coordination mechanism. What was accidental is now deliberate. What was emergent is now documented. What was implicit is now explicit.

The highest level of awareness is enshrined in CLAUDE.md. The detailed patterns live in conventions. The meta-agents (Agent Architect, Archivist) actively maintain coherence. Every agent knows the rules.
