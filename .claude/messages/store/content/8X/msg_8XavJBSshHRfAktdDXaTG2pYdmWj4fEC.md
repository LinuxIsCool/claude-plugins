I like evening 4-7 is ideal, 8 is alright too. I love the powerflows and the flows especially by David and Justin. I do like hatha / slow flow / ember 60 / yin / restorative / sound bath I do like those classes too. I really like the Saturday 10:30am Powerflow with David, and I like to go to the farmers market 12:00-1:00pm on Saturdays after that class. Help me reason through building my schedule ultrathink
