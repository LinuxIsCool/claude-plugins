Done. Created two journal entries:

## Daily Entry
**`.claude/journal/2025/12/17/2025-12-17.md`**
- Overview of today's parallel work streams
- Links to atomic entries
- Table of active sessions and their work

## Atomic Entry  
**`.claude/journal/2025/12/17/13-00-log-archaeology-and-obsidian-command.md`**

Captures:
- The recovery problem (wrong work stream initially proposed)
- Log search as the solution
- Multi-instance reality - "someone else" was another Claude
- The `/logging:obsidian` command test
- Architectural insight about logging as shared memory

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Key reflection from this session**: The logging system has organically become a shared memory layer for multi-instance coordination. No explicit design for this - it emerged from full-fidelity logging + search tools. Any Claude can now reconstruct what any other Claude was doing.

The entries are now visible in your newly-opened Obsidian vault if you refresh.
