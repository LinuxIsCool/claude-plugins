Can you check in with the knowledge graph agent to review our approach and gain mentorship? Can you also check in with the explorer agent and the archivist and librarian and agent agent to assess how our project is doing? One thing to consider is what are our costs? How much data are we producing? How semanticaly and cognitively coherent is it? And how can we increase alignment with the principles and values of this repository? ultrathink
