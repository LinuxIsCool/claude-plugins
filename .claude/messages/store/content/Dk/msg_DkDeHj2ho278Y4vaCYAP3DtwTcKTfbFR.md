Excellent question. Let me think about which agents have relevant perspectives on git.

---

## Agents with Git-Relevant Perspectives

### Tier 1: Directly Relevant

| Agent | Perspective on Git | Key Questions They'd Ask |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **process-cartographer** | Git as workflow backbone | "What's the actual commit process? Where do changes wait? What triggers a commit?" |
| **archivist** | Git as historical record | "How does commit history tell the story? What decisions are captured? What's lost?" |
| **backend-architect** | Git as reliability infrastructure | "What's the branching strategy? How do we recover from mistakes? What's the deployment flow?" |
| **temporal-validator** | Git as provenance system | "When did this fact become true? Who authored this change? What's the chain of custody?" |

### Tier 2: Valuable Complementary Views

| Agent | Perspective on Git |
|-------|-------------------|
| **systems-thinker** | Git as feedback system—how does version control shape behavior? What loops exist? |
| **agent-architect** | How should agents interact with git? Should they commit? What conventions? |
| **librarian** | What belongs in version control? What should be .gitignored? Resource tracking via git? |

## Recommended Discussion Panel

For a rich multi-perspective discussion on git utilization, I'd suggest **four agents**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    GIT DISCUSSION PANEL                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  process-cartographer     "How does work flow through git?" │
│         +                                                    │
│  archivist                "What story does git tell?"        │
│         +                                                    │
│  backend-architect        "What makes git reliable here?"    │
│         +                                                    │
│  systems-thinker          "What patterns emerge from git?"   │
│                                                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this combination:**
- **Process** + **History** + **Engineering** + **Systems** = complete picture
- They'd naturally build on each other's observations
- Different timescales: immediate workflow → historical patterns → long-term dynamics

---

## What They Might Discuss

**Questions for the repository:**
- What's the current git workflow? (Are agents committing? When?)
- What's captured in commit messages? What's lost?
- How does git history relate to the logging system?
- Should planning documents be versioned differently than code?
- What's the relationship between backlog tasks and commits?
- How do we maintain coherence across branches (if any)?
- What git patterns serve an agentic ecosystem?

---

## How to Proceed

**Option A**: I invoke `/reflect-on` style discussion—each agent writes their perspective on git utilization to their namespace

**Option B**: I facilitate a synthesized discussion—read each agent's perspective and produce a combined analysis

**Option C**: First gather data—run `git log`, examine commit patterns, then have agents discuss findings

Which approach would be most valuable?
