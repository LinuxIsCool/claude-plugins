Let's use the progressive disclosure concept of skills so that we have a much smaller initial footprint. So a lot of the top level skills shouldn't be top level skills, they should be discoverable skills. Each plugin should have just one master skill that has a summary of all the subskills it has access to. When deeper skills are needed the higher level skills can be invoked to learn more about those subskills. Do you understand what i'm saying? ultrathink
