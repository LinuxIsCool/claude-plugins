The **awareness plugin** is a self-awareness and learning plugin for Claude Code that enables systematic documentation reading, guide utilization, and technique mastery.

## Core Philosophy
- **Self-reflection** - Examine decisions and patterns
- **Anti-fragility** - Grow stronger from challenges  
- **Curiosity** - Active exploration, question assumptions
- **Self-improvement** - Compound learnings over time

## Skills (3 total)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **docs-reader** | Systematically read Claude Code documentation with a learning progression: Fundamentals → Configuration → Extension → Advanced → Mastery |
| **guide-utilizer** | Effectively use the claude-code-guide subagent for authoritative info about features, hooks, MCP servers, settings, IDE integrations, or Agent SDK |
| **techniques** | Practice and master techniques through incremental experimentation: Observe → Hypothesize → Test (small) → Learn → Compound |

## Core Principles
1. **Start small** - Begin with fundamentals
2. **Digest as you go** - Understanding > speed
3. **Compound learning** - Each concept builds on previous
4. **Maximize coherence** - Seek connections between topics
5. **Test incrementally** - Never build too far ahead of verification

## Usage
The skills are model-invoked automatically when context matches, or you can use the `/awareness:learn` command to begin a learning session on a topic.
