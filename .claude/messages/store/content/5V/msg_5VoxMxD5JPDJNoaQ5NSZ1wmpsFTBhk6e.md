Done. There's now a `journal/` folder at the root level (a real copy, not a symlink).

Reload Obsidian (Ctrl/Cmd+R) and you should see `journal/` in the file explorer. Navigate to `journal/2025/12/13/` for today's atomics.

**Note**: This is a copy, so edits here won't sync to `.claude/journal/`. We can set up a sync script later if needed, or just work from this location going forward.
