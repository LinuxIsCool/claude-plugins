OK I really like this, that sounds like good scaffolding. Can we roadmap how we might utilize the above over time? We can brainstorm, we might want timestamp awareness hook in this plugin or another complimentary plugin? We might want a kind of RAG memory hooks, like we could save our messages, my submissions and your responses as messages in a vector database, we could store conversations in a vector database, we could also create a temporal knowledge graph of our messages over time. I think it's important that we go slow. We may want to consider our architecture of plugins to build out this functionality in other plugins like a memory plugin, a knowledge graphs plugin, a youtube transcripts fetcher plugin, a skill in awareness for creating different types of agents. And a skill for creating skills. You should also have a skill for studying the various plugins and resources throughout this repository. ultrathink
