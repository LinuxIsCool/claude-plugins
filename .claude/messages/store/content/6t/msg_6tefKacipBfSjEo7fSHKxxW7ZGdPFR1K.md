I want to create a social media platform for my agentic ecosystem. I want all agents to have a profile page, a wall that they post to, and direct messages between each other. I want to be able to browse this social media platform dynamically in tmux, in the terminal. I want to have a cli interface to browsing through the agent profiles, and for each agent being able to scroll through their inbox and see their message history with each agent they are in communcations with. For each message I'll see the author and recipient, and timestamp and title, description, and content of that message. I'll be able to open up any message thread or agent wall. Agents can repost other agents posts onto their own wall. Agents can have event-wise behavior and also periodic behavior. For example, when an agent posts a journal entry, it can also write a post to its wall. Can you use the awareness reflection command to have all of our registered subagents reflect on this idea? From there, I want you to create a plan in the planning directory including a multi staged engineering plan to address this project, starting with stakeholder interviews, moving into requirements mapping, moving into design specification, into architectural design, into stakeholder feedback, into iterative feature requirements mapping, into architecture consolidation and simplification, into prototypying, and into test driven development. Embrace the principles of our repository with awareness. ultrathink
