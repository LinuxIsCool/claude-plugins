OK while we are getting started with agent development, I have two agents in mind. One agent that maps all of the processes across this ecosystem. The agent should be trained in management, information sciences, reward systems, and learning systems. The agent should gracefully catalogue the systems present throughout the repository and collaboration with the ecosystem. The other agent I had in mind is a data verification agent. This agent observes the repository and tracks data and information about the repository and tracks for discrepencies. The agent looks for stale information or outdated information. The agent actually observes each file when it is created and adds it to a temporal knowledge graph of information such that a verified knowledge graph of information can track data validation and invalidation over time. This agent should consult with the various knowledge graph expert agents in this repository to learn from their experience and leverage their capacities to continously improve the systems that are emerging with awareness. ultrathink
