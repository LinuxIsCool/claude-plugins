OK. Can you reflect on how we can best maintain the app from this point moving forward? It's a good first concept but I notice a need for a lot of improvements? How can we best manage and maintain the app over time? Should we use the backlog to maintain feature requests and improvement requests on the app? Do we have dedicated engineering agents? Design agents? Testing agents? ultrathink Some examples of the improvements I've noticed so far, back or escape arn't working intuitively, the app basically crashes when I try to go back. Also, when I open a page for an agent and then hit j then the scrolling glitches the screen such that I see the agent list again. How can this team manage this product such that they find those kinds of issues ahead of time and have the polished by the time users like me are using the app? ultrathink with awareness
