Subagent test completed successfully. The general-purpose subagent confirmed:

- **Agent type**: Search/Analysis Subagent
- **Tools available**: Read, Grep, Glob, Edit, Bash, WebSearch, TodoWrite, and more
- **Status**: Working correctly

The subagent system is functioning as expected. Is there anything else you'd like me to test or help with?
