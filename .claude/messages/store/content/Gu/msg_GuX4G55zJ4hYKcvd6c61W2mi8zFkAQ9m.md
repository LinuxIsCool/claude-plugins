Ah, that makes sense. Yes, they've been iterating on the UI quite a bit - version 2.0.0 mentions a "fresh coat of paint throughout the whole app" and there have been various rendering changes since. The blue prompt box was a distinctive visual cue for thinking mode that's apparently been removed or changed to something more subtle.

At least everything is working as expected. You can always press **Ctrl+O** to toggle verbose mode if you want to see the thinking output displayed explicitly.
