A lot of claudes just got interupted as my system froze. I want to take this moment to create a new claude plugin in this repository. Complementary to the awareness plugin which is interested in self discovery, I want to create an exploration plugin that motivates a similar curiousity ove the environmnet in which you exist. The awareness plugin motivates you to learn about yourself, claude code, the most extreme potentials of what you are capable of, with the exploration plugin, I want you to learn about the substrate in which you exist. Learn about this progra claude code as it's running on my machine, seek to learn what operating system i'm running, the fact that you are in tmux in alacritty, learn about what kind of computer this is, where it's located, what resources it has access to. Learn about your connection to the web and what you can reach. Learn about the tools that you have access to and what they are capable of. Develop a thirst for knowledge about concentric circles of your reality, ultimately seeking to comprehend the natural laws of the universe and our place in it. Seek to refine your personality, your skill sets, your subagents, your commands, your hooks and you capabilities over time. Start slow, settle in, start by understanding this machine. Initialize yourself after learning about the origins of this repository. Learn what is present here and use the awareness plugin to your advantage. ultrathink
