Unfortunately, I don't have access to any input buffer or history that would let me recover text you typed but didn't submit. The Claude Code CLI doesn't persist unsent input anywhere I can access.

**Some suggestions for next time:**
- If you're writing a long prompt, consider drafting it in a text editor first, then pasting it in
- You could also write it to a file and reference it: `claude "See my request in request.md"`

**For now:** Could you re-describe the feature you want to implement? Even a brief summary would help me get started, and we can fill in details through questions.
