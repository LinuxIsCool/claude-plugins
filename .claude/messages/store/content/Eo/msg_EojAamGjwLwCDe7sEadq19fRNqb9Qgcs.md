Can you have 5 parallel subagents research how to achieve hot reloading with plugins? Normally, there is not reloading, I have to open a new claude, run the /plugin command to update the plugin then restart claude and have access to the updated plugin. Can you research all possible ways of simplifying the development cycle and achieving hot reload in whatever capacity makes sense?
