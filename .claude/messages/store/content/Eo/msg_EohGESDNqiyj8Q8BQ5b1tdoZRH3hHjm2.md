I wonder if we can have an agent that is responsible for going back in time and analyzing the historical trajectory of our commits? How many commits do we have? Over what timeline? What is the quality and contribution of each commit? Can we develop a temporal knowledge graph over git diffs to have the ultimate understanding of the nature of our relationship with git and the nature of this project and an assessment of evaluation of our performance and our organization and our structure at each commit? We can evaluate integrity over time and we can evaluate systems and ideas and performance levels at each snapshot of history. Can you consult various agents to consider how to go about producing a plan for this project? ultrathink
