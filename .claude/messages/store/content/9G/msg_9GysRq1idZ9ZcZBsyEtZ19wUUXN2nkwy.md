Opened the concept graph in your browser.

You'll see an interactive D3.js force-directed graph with:

- **10 concept nodes** sized by connection count
- **15 relationship edges** showing RELATES_TO links
- **Color coding**:
  - Blue (`#58a6ff`) — High connectivity (6+ connections)
  - Green (`#238636`) — Active concepts
  - Dark blue (`#1f6feb`) — Verified concepts

**Interactions:**
- **Drag** nodes to reposition
- **Hover** for tooltip with definition, source, and status
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out
- **Click and drag background** to pan

The central cluster should form around **Potential Energy**, **Phase Transition**, and **Activation** — the three most connected concepts.
