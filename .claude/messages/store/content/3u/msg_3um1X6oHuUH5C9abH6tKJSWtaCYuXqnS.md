Looking at my available skills, I don't see any skills specifically from the awareness plugin listed. However, I do have a **slash command** from the awareness plugin:

- `/awareness:learn [topic]` - Begin a learning session with the awareness plugin

Slash commands work differently from skills - they expand into prompts rather than invoking specialized tool capabilities.

Would you like me to:
1. Run `/awareness:learn` to start a learning session on a topic?
2. Explore the awareness plugin directory to see what capabilities it has?
