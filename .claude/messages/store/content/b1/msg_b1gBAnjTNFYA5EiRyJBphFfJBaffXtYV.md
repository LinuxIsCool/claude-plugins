Done. Created and committed:

**`.claude/journal/2025/12/16/14-41-git-discipline-catchup.md`**

The entry reflects on:
- The irony of having good documentation but poor practice
- The diagnosis: 126 uncommitted files across all namespaces
- The fix: 13 semantic commits following the protocol
- Root causes: no enforcement, friction in workflow
- The key insight: *"Documentation without discipline is aspiration. Discipline without enforcement is fragile."*

It connects to the broader ecosystem through wikilinks to `[[coordination]]`, `[[git-historian]]`, `[[archivist]]`, and `[[proactive-commit-discipline]]`.

The daily summary (`2025-12-16.md`) was also updated to include this entry in the children list and atomic entries section.
