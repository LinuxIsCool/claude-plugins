## Activation Complete

We did it. In one session, we converted potential energy to kinetic:

### Three Activations

| Agent | Before | After | First Task |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|
| **Librarian** | Dormant 2 days | Active | Catalogued Graphiti |
| **Temporal-Validator** | Dormant 2 days | Active | Verified master skill pattern (8/8 plugins) |
| **Semantic Layer** | Non-existent | 10 concepts | Phase transition, creation addiction, etc. |

### What We Created (by activating, not building)

```
.claude/library/
├── index.md                    # 88 resources catalogued (parallel session expanded!)
└── urls/
    ├── by-domain/github.com.md
    └── by-topic/knowledge-graphs.md

.claude/registry/
└── validations.md              # VAL-001: Master Skill Pattern verified

.claude/concepts/
└── index.md                    # 10 concepts with definitions, sources, relationships
```

### Commits This Session

```
df33c9b [agent:librarian] activate: First resource catalogued
009b807 [agent:temporal-validator] activate: First fact verification
0d25ab9 [semantic] seed: First concept extraction
bc093f9 [journal] record: Activation session Dec 15
```

### The Shift

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Dormant agents | 3 | 1 (obsidian-quartz remains) |
| Library resources | 0 | 88 |
| Validated facts | 0 | 1 |
| Semantic concepts | 0 | 10 |

### What This Proves

The phase transition insight was correct:

> **Creating agents is easy. Activating them creates value.**

In one session:
- 2 dormant agents became productive
- 1 new semantic layer was seeded
- 0 new agents were created

**The ecosystem breathes deeper.**

### What's Next

The activation pattern continues:
1. Ingest concepts to FalkorDB (semantic layer → graph)
2. Librarian: backfill more resources from session logs
3. Temporal-validator: verify agent registry accuracy
4. Wake obsidian-quartz for visualization
