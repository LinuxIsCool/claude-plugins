I'm curious if you can collaborate with the knowledge graph plugin / agent to discover how the knowledge graph works in obsidian? I'm pretty sure it's the same knowledge graph in quartz. We should use the knowledge graph rendering tool from obsidian to brilliantly render different layers and views into our system including knowledge graphs from our knowledge graph databases, and our wiki structural content across our repository as well. You might want to clone quartz into our resources/ directory and create an agent who is responsible for understanding obsidian and quartz and how they apply to our repository and how to achieve goals with those applications. Like I want to say "Show me a graph of the journal" And I should see that pop up, either in the web, or in obsidian directly, but this agent can plan how to better develop our own in-house infrastructure over time that maximizes the coherence across the repository and the ecosystem of agents here. The knowledge graph agent and the obsidian/quartz agent can collaborate to better support the team. You can document these concepts in collaboration with the explorer agent and with awareness. ultrathink
