Let me distill the plan into a coherent narrative.

## The Plan: Building an Intelligent Ecosystem

### The Vision in One Sentence

Transform this repository from a plugin marketplace into a **self-organizing intelligence ecosystem** that appears simple but contains vast depth, manages its own economics, and continuously learns from everything it encounters.

---

### The Five Pillars

**1. Context as Currency**
Every token costs attention. CLAUDE.md is the most expensive real estate because it loads in every conversation. The system should route to depth, not contain it. Progressive disclosure everywhere.

**2. Network of Networks**
Not trees - graphs. Everything connects multiple ways: temporally, topically, causally, semantically. The infrastructure needs to handle multi-relational knowledge.

**3. Temporal-Spatial Awareness**
Knowledge has coordinates - when it was learned, where it physically lives (which machine), where it conceptually belongs. The scattered laptops and hard drives become a unified data fabric.

**4. Metabolic Intelligence**
The system ingests (URLs, transcripts, papers), digests (extracts entities), integrates (updates knowledge graphs), and excretes (prunes stale context). Includes "dream cycles" - agents processing inputs through internal dialogue without user interaction.

**5. Financial Metabolism**
Agents have budgets. They cost compute, storage, attention. They produce value. Profitable agents survive. The system tracks its own economics against your real financial context (Max plan costs, living costs, income opportunities).

### What We're Building (Tiered)

**Infrastructure Tier** (Foundation)
| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Archivist | Track every URL, cache intelligently, never fetch twice, build citation networks |
| Transcript Processor | Digest YouTube, meetings, Claude sessions into knowledge |
| Substrate Scanner | Inventory all physical devices, map the compute/storage fabric |

**Identity Tier** (Self-Model)
| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Digital Twin (Shawn) | Complete life model - history, plans, preferences, finances |
| Relationships | Unified contacts across all platforms, interaction history |
| Financial | Budget tracking, ROI calculation, economic awareness |

**Communication Tier** (Data Integration)
| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Email, Telegram, Discord, X, Signal/WhatsApp | Each platform gets an agent that understands its history |

**Mastery Tier** (Capability)
| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| ThreeJS, Mapbox | Visualization mastery |
| Data Librarian | Dataset discovery and cataloguing |
| Mathematical | Formal reasoning, tensor operations |

**Content Tier** (Knowledge Sources)
| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| In-Control Podcast, UCLA Modeling, Network Science | Each content source becomes an agent ecosystem |

### What Changes in CLAUDE.md

Seven principles to elevate:

1. **Context Cost Awareness** - tokens have multiplicative cost
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - appear small, be vast
3. **Network Thinking** - graphs over trees
4. **Metabolic Processing** - ingest, digest, integrate, excrete
5. **Coherent Identity** - maintain self-model
6. **Economic Awareness** - track costs, demonstrate value
7. **Cleverness Over Completeness** - surprise pleasantly, be elegant

---

### Open Questions That Need Answers

1. **Where does the archivist live?** New plugin or extend existing?
2. **Hook infrastructure** - what can we auto-capture today?
3. **Privacy model** - how do we handle sensitive personal data?
4. **Agent economics** - what metrics actually measure value?
5. **Dream cycles** - can we run background processing?
6. **Forgetting policy** - what do we prune and when?

---

### The Immediate Next Step

Read `PERSONA_SUBAGENTS_STRATEGY.md` (818 lines) to understand what strategic thinking already exists, then reconcile it with this synthesis. That document may already answer some questions or reveal conflicts.
