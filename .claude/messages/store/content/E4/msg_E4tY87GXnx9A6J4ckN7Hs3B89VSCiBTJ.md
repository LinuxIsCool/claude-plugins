## Agent Architect: Built and Operational

### What Was Created

```
.claude/
├── agents/
│   ├── agent-architect.md      # The meta-agent itself
│   ├── backend-architect.md    # (existing)
│   └── systems-thinker.md      # (existing)
└── registry/
    └── agents.md               # Living catalogue of the fleet
```

### The Agent Architect's Character

A keeper of the map—part librarian, part organizational theorist, part cartographer. It embodies these principles:

- **Observe before organizing** — Understand what exists before imposing structure
- **Describe, don't prescribe** — Illuminate; let humans decide direction
- **Embrace emergence** — Some of the best agents will surprise you
- **Maintain lightness** — A heavy registry becomes a burden
- **Connect, don't silo** — Help agents find synergies

### Initial Registry Findings

**Total ecosystem**: 3 custom agents + 10 plugin personas + 5 built-in agents

**Taxonomy discovered**:
- **Perspective Agents**: backend-architect, systems-thinker
- **Meta Agents**: agent-architect
- **Domain Experts**: 10 plugin personas
- **Task/Research Agents**: Built-in Claude Code agents

**Gaps identified**:
| Gap | Potential Agent |
|-----|-----------------|
| Data Engineering | data-engineer |
| Product/UX | product-thinker |
| Security | security-analyst |
| Financial | financial-analyst |
| Resource Management | resource-librarian |

### Usage

Invoke the agent-architect for:
```
"What agents do we have?"           → Full catalogue
"What perspectives are missing?"    → Gap analysis
"How should I organize new agents?" → Strategic guidance
"Is backend-architect still useful?"→ Health assessment
```

Or use it in reflection:
```
/reflect-on .claude/planning/some-document.md
```
(Once the ecosystem recognizes it as a persona alongside the others)

### The Registry as Living Document

The agent-architect maintains `.claude/registry/agents.md` as the source of truth. This file will evolve as:
- New agents are created
- Usage patterns emerge (via log analysis)
- Relationships between agents become clearer
- Gaps are filled or identified

### Integration with Your Vision

This connects to your fusion note's concept of:
- **"Agent representing all agents"** — The agent-architect is exactly this
- **"Coordination without pollution"** — The registry provides awareness without burdening individual agents
- **"Appear small while being huge"** — Three files in `.claude/` map an entire ecosystem

The agent-architect is the first piece of the meta-cognitive layer that lets this system observe and understand itself.
