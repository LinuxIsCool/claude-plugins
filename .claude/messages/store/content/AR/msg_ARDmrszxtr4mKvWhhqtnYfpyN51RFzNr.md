The Mentor agent has started your learning session. It noticed that "Hello" doesn't specify a particular learning goal, so it's asking you some clarifying questions:

**What brings you here today?**

The Mentor has identified several possible directions based on your workspace:

1. **Understanding Claude Code itself** - tools, skills, plugins
2. **Learning about the plugins ecosystem** - awareness, journal, agents, exploration plugins
3. **Building something new** - creating skills, plugins, or agents
4. **Understanding existing code** - the marketplace structure, master/sub-skill patterns
5. **Something else entirely**

It also noticed from your git status that you've been working on:
- Restructuring plugins to use the master skill pattern
- Planning documents about embeddings and fusion
- Developing various plugin ecosystems
- Creating subagent systems

**What would you like to learn about?** The Mentor is ready to guide you once you share your goal.
