The hooks ARE working now. Session `fb19e3f5` shows:
- Count: 1 (user-prompt-submit.sh worked)
- Summary: "I'm ready to assist with your software engineering tasks." (auto-summary worked)

The plugin cache was cleared. **Try starting a new Claude session now** - it should pick up the fixed hooks and generate summaries automatically.
