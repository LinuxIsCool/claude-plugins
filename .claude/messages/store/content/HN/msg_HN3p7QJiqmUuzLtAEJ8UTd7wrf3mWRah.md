### Notable Discovery

The daily journal entry was already enhanced by a parallel session. Two sessions, working independently, both contributed to the same day's journal—demonstrating the very emergence we've been building infrastructure for.

The ecosystem is using the journal for cross-session memory without any explicit coordination protocol.
