Done. The synthesis has been expanded from ~4KB to ~18KB. Here's what v0.2 now includes:

## What's New in v0.2

**Five Core Primitives** (was three):
1. Context as Currency - with attention/routing metaphor
2. Network of Networks - with edge type taxonomy
3. **Temporal-Spatial Dimensions** - physical network vision, knowledge timestamps, universe-scale thinking
4. Metabolic Intelligence - expanded with **fractal conversations** and **dream cycles**
5. **Financial Metabolism** - economic regulation, cost/value tracking, seedfunding model

**New Major Sections:**
- **The Cleverness Aspiration** - aesthetic intelligence, surprise criterion, anti-patterns
- **Mathematical Foundations** - tensors, percolation theory, semantic density, tools to master
- **Personal Data Integration** - complete data source inventory, integration architecture, digital twin spec
- **Visualization Vision** - transcript views, knowledge graph views, repository topology
- **Agent Ecosystem Architecture** - plugin-agent correspondence, coordination patterns, YouTube-as-agent pattern

**Expanded Concrete Entities** - organized into tiers:
- Infrastructure (archivist, transcript processor, substrate scanner)
- Identity (digital twin, relationships, financial)
- Communication (email, telegram, discord, X, signal/whatsapp)
- Mastery (threejs, mapbox, data librarian, folkjs, mathematical)
- Content (in-control podcast, UCLA modeling, network science)

**Seven Principles for CLAUDE.md** elevation identified

**Eight Open Questions** surfaced

The document is now denser - same source material but more structure, more actionability, more architecture. Ready for your feedback or to proceed to strategy reconciliation.
