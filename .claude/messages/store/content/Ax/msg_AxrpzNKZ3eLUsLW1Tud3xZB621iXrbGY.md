I'm interested in a plugin that creates a hook that enables all claudes to always know the correct time. I'm not sure if this should go in the schedule plugin or the awareness plugin or another plugin. I wrote a bit about this in planning in the past, can you review those notes and also consult with the agent agent and with awareness? ultrathink
