Yes! Based on your current schedule and the system's preference learning, here's what I know:

**Your Yoga Preferences:**

**Studio**: Ember Studios Duncan

**Current Schedule** (4 classes/week):
| Day | Time | Class | Instructor |
|-----|------|-------|------------|
| Monday | 5:30 PM | Powerflow | David |
| Tuesday | 7:00 PM | Flow | Justin |
| Friday | 5:30 PM | Powerflow | Justin |
| Saturday | 10:30 AM | Powerflow | David |

**Inferred Patterns:**
- **Preferred instructors**: David and Justin
- **Preferred style**: Powerflow (3 of 4 classes)
- **Weekday timing**: Evening classes (5:30-7:00 PM range)
- **Weekend timing**: Late morning (10:30 AM)

The schedule plugin's yoga-scheduler skill uses these existing blocks as your "preference database" - it can fetch the Ember Studios schedule and suggest classes that match your established patterns (instructor preferences, time slots, class styles).

Would you like me to check this week's studio schedule and suggest classes based on these preferences?
