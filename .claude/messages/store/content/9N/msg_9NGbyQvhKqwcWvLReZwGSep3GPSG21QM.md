OK can you inform the agent architect agent of our intentions? In addition to the above, consider the development of librarian agent who manages resources like urls, and the archivist agent who is sluething through our claude code logs, our git status and commit history, and all of our knowledge graphs, and working with the library resources, and all the planning documents, and the journal entries, and the data bases, to manage a coherent mapping of everything that is being collected, created, maintained, and metabolized. ultrathink
