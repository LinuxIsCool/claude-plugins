Can you make another agent in the awareness plugin that is responsible for tone and style and design patterns and values and principles? That agent should be helpful in addressing the above. Have that agent discover the values of this repository that ensure cleanliness, maintainability, reliability, simpleness, and leaness, while enabling unversal expansion of semantic and cognitive capacities using principles like progressive disclosure, context engineering, embeddings, graph structures, RAG, agentic systems like claude code framework embracing skills, commands, hooks, system prompts, subagents, headless mode, and the anthropic sdk, along with an ecosystem of subagents that compound their coordination capacity over time. ultrathink Have the style awareness agent learn from relevant agents and relevant log history from this repo. Have the agent find 10 historical prompts that have been used in the construction of this repository, written by me, Shawn Anderson, and a handful of planning documents and agent specifications, and skill exploration to improve the richness and comprehension of the style and tone and intention of Shawn Anderson and this repository and this agentic ecosystem. ultrathink
