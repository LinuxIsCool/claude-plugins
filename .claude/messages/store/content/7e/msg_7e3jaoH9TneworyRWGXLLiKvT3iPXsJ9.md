Are you able to search the logs intelligently? Can you search the logs to see how I created the knowledge graph plugin? Can you use that plugin to think about how this system can learn the best techiques for building and  applying knowledge graphs? I'm curious about temporal knowledge graphs. I want if we can load our claude code logs into a temporal knowledge graph? It should be cool to load each event into a knowledge graph and use that to temporally digest the history of all of our discussions. ultrathink
