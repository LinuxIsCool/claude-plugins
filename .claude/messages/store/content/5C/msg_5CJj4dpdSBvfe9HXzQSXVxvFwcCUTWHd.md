Done. Now if cache values are suspiciously low (incomplete data), it defaults to 31% minimum instead of showing near-0%.

The flash might still happen briefly since 31% is still green (< 50%). If it's really bothering you, we could set a higher minimum or change the color thresholds. But hopefully the flash is less noticeable now since it won't jump from near-0% to 80%+.
