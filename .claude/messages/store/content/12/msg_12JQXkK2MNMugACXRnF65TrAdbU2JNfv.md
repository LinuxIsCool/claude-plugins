I'm reflecting on inter-agent communications. One way you can do that is observing git. Another way, is, we had another agent just create a reflection command, do you see that? And our agent is also creating an agent for managing all agents. So as that agent develops, we should see increased capacity for agent to agent communication. ultrathink
