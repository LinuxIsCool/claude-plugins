OK so let's differentiate between agents and plugin personas. Plugin personas ARE agents. Each plugin should have one plugin persona agent. A plugin can have more agents that that, it can have any number of agents. The plugin persona agent should have awareness of all the skills, agents, commands, capabilities, memories, and intentions of a given plugin. Other subagents of a plugin can have their own specific utility. ultrathink
