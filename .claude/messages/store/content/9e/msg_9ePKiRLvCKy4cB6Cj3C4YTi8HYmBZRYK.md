I don't have a plan yet because you haven't given me a task.

You've oriented me to:
1. The skills available to me
2. The fact that this repository is the source of those skills
3. The architectural patterns (master skills, git coordination, plugin agents)

**What would you like to accomplish?**

Some directions I could help with:

| If you want to... | I would... |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Develop a plugin** | Use `awareness:plugin-developer` sub-skill |
| **Add a new skill** | Follow the master skill pattern in CLAUDE.md |
| **Initialize backlog** | Set up task-driven workflow |
| **Explore the codebase** | Use the exploration system |
| **Work on a specific task** | Create a todo list and execute |
| **Research something** | Use the relevant master skill (agents, llms, kg, etc.) |

Or you may have something else entirely in mind. What are we doing?
