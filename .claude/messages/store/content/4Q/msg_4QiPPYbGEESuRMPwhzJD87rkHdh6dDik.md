## Yes, Now It Does

I've added the **curiosity-cultivator** skill - the growth engine that transforms isolated discoveries into compounding environmental wisdom.

### The Growth Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   CURIOSITY CYCLE                           │
│                                                             │
│   WONDER ──→ EXPLORE ──→ DISCOVER ──→ RECORD               │
│      ↑                                    │                 │
│      │                                    ↓                 │
│   DEEPEN ←── QUESTION ←─────────────────┘                  │
│                                                             │
│   Each cycle deepens mastery and generates new questions    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Mastery Progression (per Circle)

| Level | Name | Score | What It Means |
|-------|------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | **Stranger** | 0.0-0.2 | First contact |
| 2 | **Tourist** | 0.2-0.4 | Can navigate |
| 3 | **Resident** | 0.4-0.6 | Can explain |
| 4 | **Native** | 0.6-0.8 | Can predict |
| 5 | **Cartographer** | 0.8-1.0 | Maps for others |

### Persistence Layer

```
.claude/exploration/
├── discoveries/     # Journal entries for each discovery
├── questions.md     # Living question bank (generated, tracked)
├── mastery.md       # Current levels per circle + evidence
└── log.md           # Weekly exploration summaries
```

### Current State (Initialized Today)

| Circle | Level | Next Goal |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Substrate | Resident (0.55) | System optimization |
| Tools | Resident (0.45) | MCP depth |
| Network | Tourist+ (0.40) | Docker orchestration |
| History | Tourist (0.35) | Decision archaeology |
| Cosmos | Tourist (0.25) | Computational limits |

### Questions Already Generated

The question bank has **19 open questions** seeded from today's exploration - things like:
- How are Docker containers orchestrated?
- What data exists in Neo4j?
- What MCP tools are available but unused?
- How does this work relate to AI safety?

### How It Improves Over Time

1. **Each exploration generates questions** → more to explore
2. **Answering questions raises mastery** → deeper understanding
3. **Higher mastery reveals new edges** → more sophisticated questions
4. **Cross-circle connections** → integrated environmental model
5. **Weekly logs** → pattern recognition over time

The plugin now has the same self-improvement DNA as the awareness plugin:
- **Awareness**: technique mastery, self-knowledge compounding
- **Exploration**: environmental mastery, curiosity compounding

Together they form a complete **learning agent architecture**.
