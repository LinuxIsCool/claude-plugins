This is great context! Let me help you think through this systematically.

## Your Preference Profile

```
ANCHORS:
├── Saturday 10:30am Powerflow (David) ⭐ MUST HAVE
└── Saturday 12:00-1:00pm Farmers Market 🥬

TIMES:
├── Ideal: 4:00-7:00pm
├── Acceptable: up to 8:00pm
└── Weekend exception: Saturday 10:30am

INSTRUCTORS:
├── ⭐ David (Powerflow, Flow)
├── ⭐ Justin (Powerflow, Flow)
└── Others for gentle classes

STYLES:
├── ACTIVE (energy): Powerflow, Flow
└── GENTLE (recovery): Hatha, Slow Flow, Ember 60, Yin, Restorative, Sound Bath
```

## Reasoning Through Your Week

### Start with the Anchor

```
SATURDAY (fixed)
├── 10:30am  Powerflow (David) ⭐
├── 11:30am  [end class]
├── 12:00pm  Farmers Market 🥬
└── 1:00pm   [free]
```

This is your **anchor point** - the non-negotiable that everything else builds around.

### Weekly Balance Question

**How many yoga classes feel right per week?**

| Frequency | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| 2x/week | Saturday + 1 weekday evening |
| 3x/week | Saturday + 2 weekday evenings |
| 4x/week | Saturday + 3 weekday evenings |
| 5x/week | Saturday + 4 weekday evenings (dedicated practice) |

### Active vs. Gentle Balance

Since you love both energizing AND restorative classes, consider:

```
OPTION A: Alternating Pattern
├── Mon: Flow/Powerflow (active) 🔥
├── Wed: Yin/Slow Flow (gentle) 🌤️
└── Sat: Powerflow (active) 🔥

OPTION B: Bookend Pattern
├── Tue: Flow (active) 🔥 - build energy for week
├── Thu: Restorative/Yin (gentle) 🌤️ - recover before weekend
└── Sat: Powerflow (active) 🔥 - peak energy day

OPTION C: Immersive Pattern (4x/week)
├── Mon: Flow (active) 🔥
├── Wed: Slow Flow (gentle) 🌤️
├── Fri: Yin/Sound Bath (gentle) 🌤️ - prep for weekend
└── Sat: Powerflow (active) 🔥
```

### Thinking About Energy Flow

```
Week Energy Map:

Mon   Tue   Wed   Thu   Fri   Sat   Sun
 │     │     │     │     │     │     │
 ▼     ▼     ▼     ▼     ▼     ▼     ▼
START ─────────────────────────► PEAK ──► REST

If Saturday is your PEAK (Powerflow with David):
- Early week: Build energy (Flow)
- Mid week: Maintain/recover (Gentle)
- Late week: Prepare for peak (Light or rest)
- Saturday: POWERFLOW 🔥
- Sunday: Natural rest
```

### My Suggested Template

Based on your preferences, here's what I'd propose:

```
YOUR WEEKLY YOGA RHYTHM

TUESDAY 5:30-6:30pm
├── Style: Flow or Powerflow
├── Why: Build energy early-mid week
├── Ideal: David or Justin if available
└── Backup: Any Flow class

THURSDAY 7:00pm
├── Style: Slow Flow / Yin / Restorative
├── Why: Recovery day, gentle into weekend
├── Instructor: Open (gentle classes, instructor less critical)
└── Time: 7pm gives you evening flexibility

SATURDAY 10:30am ⭐
├── Style: Powerflow (David)
├── Why: Your anchor, peak day
├── Followed by: Farmers Market 12pm 🥬
└── Status: NON-NEGOTIABLE

Total: 3 classes/week
Balance: 2 active 🔥 + 1 gentle 🌤️
```

## Questions to Refine

1. **Does 3x/week feel right?** Or do you want more/fewer?

2. **Tuesday + Thursday** work as your weekday evenings? Or different days better?

3. **Do you want the Farmers Market as a schedule block?** (Helps visualize the Saturday flow)

4. **Any evening commitments** I should know about that would block certain days?

---

Once you confirm the pattern, I'll:
1. Create your Saturday anchor blocks (Powerflow + Farmers Market)
2. Create template blocks for Tue/Thu evenings
3. The skill will then match specific classes each week to these slots

What resonates? What would you adjust?
