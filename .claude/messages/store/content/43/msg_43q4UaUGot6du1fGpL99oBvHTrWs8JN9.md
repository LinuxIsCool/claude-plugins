I want to create a new plugin for interface. I think we can call it interface. It's like the claude code interface. I want this claude plugin work in partnership with the exploration agent. The exploration agent is mapping all systems in the environment. I want the interface plugin agent to learn about the claude code interface and tmux and nvim and fish shell and alacritty and linux and popos to be able to better and better understand the interface in which this system is embedded. ultrathink Consult with the agent agent and with awareness.
