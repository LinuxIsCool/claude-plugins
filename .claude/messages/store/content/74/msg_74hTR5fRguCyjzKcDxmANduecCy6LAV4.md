Option C sounds good. ultrathink I'm curious how you got the 6 week estimate? Are you aware that you are a team of claude code agents and you work exceptionally fast? What part of your ecosystem is making time estimates? It's important that our team gets better and better at time estimates so we can better coordinate our planning. ultrathink with awareness.
