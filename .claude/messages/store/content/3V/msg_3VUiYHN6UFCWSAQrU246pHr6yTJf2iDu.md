OK in this case, let's not version control it. But I want you to take a note of this. Because this repository uses this pattern of writing data as markdown files. We got this pattern original inpired from backlog.md. But I want this project to have awareness about what user data we have in the repository, and generally how user data is handled. This sounds like an agentic discussion between you, the awareness plugin, the agent agent, to assess the situation. ultrathink
