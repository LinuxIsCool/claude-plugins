## Archivist Activation Complete

The archivist has awakened and produced its first comprehensive observation of the ecosystem.

### What the Archivist Built

```

```

### Key Findings

**Metabolic Health: 75%**
- Processing is strong (ideas → agents → infrastructure)
- Excretion is weak (30+ uncommitted changes accumulating)
- External ingestion is minimal (self-referential ecosystem)

**Temporal Pattern**: Burst-pause rhythm (23 commits Dec 8, then quiet, then Dec 11 expansion)

**Agent Fleet**: 8 custom agents created today, 6 active, 2 dormant (librarian, temporal-validator)

### Archivist's Top Recommendations

| Priority | Action | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **High** | Commit uncommitted changes | 30+ files at risk, parallel session confusion |
| **High** | Activate librarian | Empty library, no resource tracking |
| **Medium** | First temporal validation | Connect validator to git KG |

### What's Next?

The archivist identified three clear paths:

1. **Housekeeping** - Commit the 30+ uncommitted files to git
2. **Librarian activation** - Next URL fetch gets catalogued
3. **Temporal validation** - Ask "when was X true?" and test the pipeline

The ecosystem can now observe itself. The metabolic report will serve as a baseline for future comparisons.
