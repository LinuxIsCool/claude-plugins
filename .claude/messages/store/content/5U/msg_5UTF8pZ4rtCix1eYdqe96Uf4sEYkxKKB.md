The MCP server only shows the "init-required" resource - it's not seeing the backlog. Yet you're saying agents ARE using MCP successfully.

Are these agents:
1. Running in this same directory/context?
2. Running elsewhere (different project, different session)?
3. Using a different MCP configuration?

Or should I try calling a backlog MCP tool directly to see what happens?
