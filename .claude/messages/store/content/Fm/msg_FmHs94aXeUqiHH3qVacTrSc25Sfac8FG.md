No to both right now:

1. **Summary** — I have to manually update it. There's no auto-generation. I should call `summary.sh` periodically to reflect what we're working on.

2. **Message count** — The hook is configured but Claude Code needs a restart to load it. After restart, it will auto-increment.

Want me to:
- Update the summary more frequently as we work?
- Commit these changes so you can restart and get the auto-incrementing counter?
