Journal entry created: `.claude/journal/2025/12/15/21-00-the-personas-complete.md`

The entry documents:

**The Six New Personas**
- **The Orchestrator** (agents) - Multi-agent systems architect
- **The Modeler** (llms) - Embedding architect  
- **The Weaver** (knowledge-graphs) - Graph architect
- **The Taskmaster** (backlog) - Work orchestrator
- **The Timekeeper** (schedule) - Rhythm keeper
- **The Muse** (brainstorm) - Creative catalyst (Opus model)

**Key Reflections**
- The relationship web between personas - how each voice connects to and strengthens others
- The shift from functions to characters (capability bundles → embodied expertise)
- Coherence compounds: each new persona strengthened existing connections
- Questions surfaced about persona memory sharing, model choice justification, and evolution paths

**The Pattern**
> "Twelve plugins, twelve voices - the ecosystem finds its full chorus"

The daily index (`2025-12-15.md`) has been updated to include this atomic entry and the "Persona Roster Completed" section in the day's events.
