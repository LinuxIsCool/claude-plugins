/plugin-dev:create-plugin Create a plugin that uses headless claude haiku to do appropriate version control for the repository in the background upon every agent stop hook. Please deeply analyze this repository first and our commit histories. I want to achieve this results where each commit is associated with a particularly named agent that matches the logs that are being generated and the journal entries that are being generated. Do logs and journal entries currently have agent names? I just got agent names working in the statusline yesterday so I'm not sure if all this infrastructure is coherent and connected yet. I want agent names and IDs to be consistent about the statusline, logs, commits, and journal entries.  ultrathink with awareness
