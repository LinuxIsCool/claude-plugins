## Session Summary

### What We Started With

You asked: **"What skills do you have access to?"**

This was an orientation question to understand the plugin ecosystem.

### What We Did

1. **Orientation** - I listed the 12 plugins and their skills
2. **Repository analysis** - Explored how this repo IS the source of those skills
3. **Rabbit hole** - You noticed the backlog MCP showed "not initialized"
4. **Investigation** - I spawned 3 research agents, read source code, searched the web
5. **Wrong conclusion** - I thought there was a cwd bug in Backlog.md
6. **Correction** - You pointed out agents DO use MCP successfully
7. **More investigation** - Found session logs showing direct file operations
8. **Another wrong conclusion** - I thought agents bypass MCP and use Read/Write/Edit
9. **Final correction** - You clarified new sessions have full MCP tools; this session is just stale

### What We Accomplished

Honestly? **Not much.**

I spent most of the session chasing a non-problem. The backlog system works fine - this session just has stale MCP state from startup.

### What We Could Have Done

If I'd simply asked "have you tried a fresh session?" earlier, we could have moved on to actual work.

Is there something you'd like to accomplish now?
