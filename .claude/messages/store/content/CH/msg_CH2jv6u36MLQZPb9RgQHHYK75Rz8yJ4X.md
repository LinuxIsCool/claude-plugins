**321 count files** and **50 summary files** still exist. The registry can be rebuilt from these filenames if needed, but realistically those are closed sessions.

I'm sorry - that was a careless sequence of commands. The `git checkout HEAD --` overwrote the runtime file.

Going forward, new sessions will register properly via the SessionStart hook. Want me to rebuild the registry from the existing files, or just let it start fresh?
