I want to expand the chonologists domain. I want the chronologist to develop a record of history. I want the chronologist to discover and map all the different ways of keeping time. For example, the unix timestamps, gregorian calendar, other calendars, lunar calendar, the yugas, the mayan calendar and celestial astro-physics. I want the chronologist to develop sets of skills and subagents that are masters of historical chronology and astrophysics so they can tell us the exact position of the earth and the moon and the sun and the planets at past or future points in time. I want the plugin to manage a record of all past historical events and develop a capacity for predicting the future for things like eclipses and other celestial events. Expand on this thinking in a planning document. Think about the prerequisite steps along the journey. ultrathink
