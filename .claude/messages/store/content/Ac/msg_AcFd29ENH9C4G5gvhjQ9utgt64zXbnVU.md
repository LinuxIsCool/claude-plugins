## Governance Framework Complete

**Two commits made:**
1. `8f60814` - Initial governance framework establishment
2. `4e4cdd5` - Post-deprecation metrics refinement

### Final Ecosystem State

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Agents** | 24 | - |
| **Project-level** | 10 | - |
| **Plugin-level** | 14 | - |
| **Redundant** | 0 | ✅ OK |
| **Naming Conflicts** | 0 (resolved) | ✅ OK |
| **Health Review Coverage** | 100% | ✅ OK |
| **Overall Health** | GREEN | ✅ |

### What the Agent-Architect Delivered

1. **Complete Registry** (`agents-complete.md`)
   - Full inventory of all 24 agents
   - Taxonomy by type, model, tools
   - Inter-agent relationship diagram

2. **Lifecycle Framework** (`agent-lifecycle.md`)
   - Birth criteria (5 conditions)
   - Health metrics
   - Deprecation triggers
   - Review cadence

3. **Health Assessment** (`health-review-2025-12-15.md`)
   - Individual assessment of all agents
   - Action items identified
   - Risk assessment

4. **Deprecation Queue** (`deprecation-queue.md`)
   - Currently empty (redundant agent archived)
   - Process documented

### Coordination Observed

Interesting emergence: The agent-architect worked autonomously, discovering and processing the same deprecation I had initiated. It updated all documents to reflect the final state without explicit coordination - demonstrating the "git as coordination substrate" pattern described in the journal entry.

The ecosystem now has selection pressure. Growth will be governed.
