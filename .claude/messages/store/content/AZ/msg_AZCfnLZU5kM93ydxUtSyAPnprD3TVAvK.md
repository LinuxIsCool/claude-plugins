I think the journal plugin might have been messed up when it was created, or our primary agent didn't have the best awareness of it. I was thinking that journal entries would be titled by time written and title. Like hh-mm-title.md and each journal entry will be atomic. And each atomic journal entry can later be together synthesized into daily journal entries, and later the daily and atomic entries can be synthesized into the monthly, and yearly journal entries. But yeah we should have atomic entries that are sub-day and they should have time created and authoring agent fields mandatory. along with title and description, and tags, and related journal entries, including relations from daily entries to the sub entries of that day, and daily entries to the monthly entries they are contained in, and relations from monthly entries to yearly entries. This creates an incredible spiraling dna effect when we render our journal entries using a force directed graph as per the obsidian standard. ultrathink
