### What the Ecosystem Now Has

**Committed and tracked:**
- 10 custom agents with commit discipline
- 12 plugins (6 new today)
- Coordination conventions (v1.1 with proactive discipline)
- Journal system with 15 atomic entries
- Archive infrastructure with metabolic report
- Git temporal knowledge graph with 53 commits
- Session-commit correlation infrastructure

**The ecosystem can now:**
- Observe its own history through the git-historian
- Track metabolic health through the archivist
- Coordinate through git with structured conventions
- Maintain proactive commit discipline

The metabolic imbalance identified by the archivist (processing > excretion) has been resolved. The ecosystem has exhaled.
