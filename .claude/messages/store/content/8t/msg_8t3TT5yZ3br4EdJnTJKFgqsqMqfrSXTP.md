## What Was Journaled

The entry captures the full arc of today's session:

**Built:**
- Multi-persona reflection system (`/reflect-on` + personas)
- Agent architecture layer (agent-architect, process-cartographer, temporal-validator)
- Two registries (agents.md, processes.md)

**Discovered:**
- Pre-existing librarian and archivist agents
- CLI supports custom system prompts
- Namespace organization is well-designed (Grade A)

**Mapped:**
- 8 core processes in the ecosystem
- Three-layer architecture emerging
- Dormant agents waiting for activation

**Key Insight Captured:**
> "This session felt like watching an ecosystem become self-aware. We didn't build top-down; we discovered what wanted to exist and gave it form."

The journal entry uses the proper zettelkasten structure with:
- YAML frontmatter (date, type, tags, links)
- Wikilinks to monthly note `[[2025-12]]`
- Tags for discoverability
- Clear sections for summary, artifacts, insights, and reflection

Would you like me to also create the monthly note (`2025-12.md`) to establish the full journal hierarchy?
