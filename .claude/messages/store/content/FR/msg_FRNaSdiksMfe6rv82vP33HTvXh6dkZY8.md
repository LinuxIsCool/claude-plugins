**Yes, significant activity!** The ecosystem has been busy:

### New Agents Created

### Commit Plan Executed

The 90 uncommitted files are now committed. Git status is clean except for:
- Archive files (just created by archivist)
- New `.obsidian/` directory
- Session log modifications

### Archivist's Archive

All 6 archive files now populated:
- `metabolism.md` - Metabolic state
- `patterns/temporal.md` - Time patterns
- `patterns/topical.md` - Theme clusters
- `patterns/agent-activity.md` - Agent behavior
- `coherence/gaps.md` - Missing elements
- `history/2025-12-13-snapshot.md` - Point-in-time capture

The ecosystem is alive and metabolizing. Multiple agents/sessions have been working in parallel, each contributing to the architecture.
