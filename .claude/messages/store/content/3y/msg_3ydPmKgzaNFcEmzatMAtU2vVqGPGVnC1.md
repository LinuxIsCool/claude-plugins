**Found it.** You were in the middle of the **Messages Plugin** development:

## Where You Left Off

**Session `fbc37a65`**: You ran `/feature-dev:feature-dev` for a universal messaging plugin and extensive research was done. Three specs were created:

| Spec | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **1** | `specs/01-minimal-viable.md` | MVP implementation (~400 lines) |
| **2** | `specs/02-full-content-addressed.md` | Production implementation (~500 lines) |
| **3** | `specs/03-pragmatic-phased.md` | Phased implementation (~450 lines) |

**You asked**: "What do you recommend out of 1, 2, and 3?"

**Session `70b03ab6`** (continuation attempt): Already provided a recommendation:
> **Spec 1 (Minimal Viable)** with strategic modifications - reasoning was about "feedback velocity" - each week without working code is a week without learning.

---

Would you like me to:
1. **Read the recommendation in full** from the interrupted session
2. **Review the 3 specs** and give a fresh recommendation
3. **Start implementing** Spec 1 as previously recommended
4. **Something else** from that session
