OK for the LLMs Plugin, I want it to embrace the theme of learning and go through a learning journey, I want it to plan for many iterations of embedding architectures, the plugin will explore more and more architectures over time. In the new plugin, I want you to create a skill for each of these independent approaches. I want it to create a skill for each resource in resources/embeddings/ for each directory in that directory, a skill should be created in the LLM plugin. For each of those skills, the agent should have mastery of every capability offered by those repositories, they should have knowledge of the readme and a map of the territory for each one, with progressive access to skills and techniques and examples and resources for each of those packages. Please first use three parallel subagents to search and gather all necessary prerequisite information including following the norms and patterns of the plugin development in this repository to prepare yourself before spinning up 10 subagents to study each repository to learn what it can offer in working with LLMs and embeddings from claude code and building the skills to do that by using the skill building skill offered by the awareness plugin. ultrathink
