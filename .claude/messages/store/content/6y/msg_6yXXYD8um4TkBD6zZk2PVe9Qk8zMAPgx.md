**Current state:**

| Plugin | In marketplace.json | In plugins/ directory |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| brainstorm | ✅ | ✅ |
| logging | ✅ | ✅ |
| awareness | ✅ | ✅ |
| schedule | ✅ | ✅ |
| agents | ❌ | ✅ (committed) |
| llms | ❌ | ✅ (committed) |

The `agents` and `llms` plugins were created and committed, but I only added `awareness` and `schedule` to marketplace.json (since those were the ones you asked about).

Want me to register all 6 plugins?
