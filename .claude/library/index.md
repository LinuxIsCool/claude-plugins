## Overview

The library catalogues external resources accessed by the ecosystem. Every URL fetched, paper referenced, and dataset discovered gets a record here.

**Purpose**: Provenance tracking, deduplication, citation management.

**Principle**: "We shouldn't make the same web request twice unnecessarily."
