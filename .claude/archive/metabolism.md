# Ecosystem Metabolism

*First observation by the Archivist*
*2025-12-13*

---

## Current State: Day 6

The ecosystem is **6 days old** (first commit Dec 8, 2025). What began as a brainstorm plugin has evolved into a multi-agent cognitive architecture with temporal awareness.

### Vital Signs

| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Git commits | 27 | Healthy growth |
| Session logs | 52 | Active conversations |
| Journal entries | 16 | Reflective practice emerging |
| Custom agents | 8 | Fleet established |
| Plugins | 12 | Domain coverage expanding |
| Knowledge graphs | 1 | Git history in FalkorDB |
| Uncommitted changes | 30+ | Significant pending work |

---

## Metabolic Flow

### Ingestion (What's Coming In)

```
EXTERNAL                         INTERNAL
────────                         ────────
Web resources (rare)      →      Planning documents (active)
Documentation reads       →      Session transcripts (constant)
User requests            →      Journal reflections (daily)
```

**Observation**: External resource ingestion is minimal. The ecosystem is largely self-referential, metabolizing its own planning documents and conversation logs.

### Processing (What's Being Transformed)

| Input | Transformation | Output |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Vision documents | Multi-persona reflection | Perspectives, synthesis |
| Session conversations | Logging plugin | Markdown transcripts |
| Daily work | Journal plugin | Atomic entries, daily notes |
| Git history | Git historian | Temporal knowledge graph |
| Agent ideas | Agent architect | Agent definitions |

**Observation**: Rich transformation pipeline. Ideas become agents become processes become documentation.

### Output (What's Being Produced)

**Active Production:**
- Agent definitions (`.claude/agents/`) - 8 agents
- Planning documents (`.claude/planning/`) - 12 documents
- Journal entries (`.claude/journal/`) - 16 entries
- Perspectives (`.claude/perspectives/`) - 11 reflections
- Registry entries (`.claude/registry/`) - 2 registries

**Dormant Output Locations:**
- `.claude/archive/` - Empty until now
- `.claude/library/` - Empty (librarian dormant)

### Excretion (What's Being Pruned)

**Healthy Excretion:**
- Individual SKILL.md files → Master skill pattern (30+ files deleted/consolidated)
- This shows architectural maturation

**Accumulation (Not Yet Excreted):**
- 30+ uncommitted changes sitting in working tree
- No archive snapshots exist yet

## Active vs Dormant

### Active Agents (Invoked Today)

| Agent | Last Activity | Output |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| agent-architect | Today | Registry, journal entries |
| process-cartographer | Today | Process registry |
| git-historian | Today | FalkorDB knowledge graph |
| backend-architect | Today | Fusion reflection |
| systems-thinker | Today | Fusion reflection |

### Dormant Agents (Defined But Not Invoked)

| Agent | Infrastructure Ready? | Waiting For |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| **librarian** | Yes (`.claude/library/` exists) | External resources to catalogue |
| **archivist** | Yes (this activation) | Now active |
| **temporal-validator** | Partial (needs FalkorDB connection) | First validation task |

### Plugin Activity

| Plugin | Status | Last Commit |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| logging | Active | Dec 8 (11 commits) |
| brainstorm | Active | Dec 8 (genesis) |
| schedule | Active | Dec 11 |
| awareness | Active | Dec 11-13 |
| journal | Active | Dec 11-13 |
| agents | Defined | Dec 11 |
| llms | Defined | Dec 11 |
| knowledge-graphs | Defined | Dec 13 (uncommitted) |
| exploration | Defined | Dec 13 (uncommitted) |
| backlog | Defined | Dec 13 (uncommitted) |
| interface | Defined | Dec 13 (uncommitted) |
| agentnet | Defined | Dec 13 (uncommitted) |

**Observation**: Rapid plugin definition outpacing commit cadence. 6 plugins exist only in uncommitted changes.

---

## Temporal Patterns

### Development Rhythm

```
Dec 8:  ████████████████████████ 23 commits (genesis burst)
Dec 9:  (no commits)
Dec 10: (no commits)
Dec 11: ████ 4 commits (schedule + awareness)
Dec 12: (no commits)
Dec 13: (active work, uncommitted)
```

**Pattern**: Burst development followed by integration pauses. Dec 8 was 23 commits in one day. Then quiet. Then Dec 11 brought new capabilities.

### Hourly Pattern (Dec 8)

```
Hour 17: ████████████ 12 commits (peak intensity)
Hour 16: █████ 5 commits
Hour 14-15: ██ 2 commits
```

The logging plugin was born in an hour of intense iteration.

### Session Duration

52 session logs suggest frequent, short interactions rather than marathon sessions. The ecosystem prefers many small conversations over few large ones.

## Knowledge Graph Status

### Git History Graph (FalkorDB: `git_history`)

| Component | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Commit nodes | 27 |
| File nodes | 153 |
| Author nodes | 1 |
| MODIFIED edges | 217 |
| FOLLOWED_BY edges | 26 |
| AUTHORED_BY edges | 27 |

**Quality Scores (repository averages):**
- Integrity: 0.80 (good convention adherence)
- Contribution: 0.62 (moderate value per commit)
- Complexity: 0.48 (reasonable scope)

### Other Knowledge Stores

- **Graphiti/Zep**: Not yet connected
- **Conversation memory**: Via logging plugin only
- **Entity extraction**: Not yet implemented

---

## Coherence Assessment

### Alignment: Planning → Action

| Planning Document | Corresponding Implementation |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 2025-12-13-fusion.md | Partial (agents created, KG started) |
| 2025-12-13-planning.md | Active (primitives defined) |
| agent-social-network-proposal.md | Designed (agentnet plugin) |
| coordination conventions | Implemented (CLAUDE.md, agents enhanced) |

**Coherence**: High. Planning documents are being acted upon.

### Namespace Hygiene

| Area | Grade | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Root directory | A | Only 3 markdown files |
| `.claude/` | A- | Well-organized, 100+ files |
| `plugins/` | B+ | Master skill pattern adopting |
| Uncommitted | C | 30+ changes need commit |

### Registry Accuracy

- **Agent registry**: Current (updated today)
- **Process registry**: Current (created today)
- **Plugin registry**: Outdated (marketplace.json lagging)

---

## Gaps Identified

### Infrastructure Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Uncommitted changes | Risk of loss, parallel confusion | High |
| Empty library | No resource tracking | Medium |
| No archive history | No snapshots for comparison | Medium |
| Temporal validator disconnected | No fact verification | Low (infrastructure exists) |

### Capability Gaps

| Missing | Would Enable |
|---------|--------------|
| Product/UX perspective | User value analysis |
| Security perspective | Threat modeling |
| Semantic enrichment | Conceptual search over git |
| Session correlation | Link commits to conversations |

### Process Gaps

| Gap | Observation |
|-----|-------------|
| Commit cadence | 2 days of work uncommitted |
| Library curation | URLs not being catalogued |
| Archive snapshots | No periodic state capture |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Commit the uncommitted** - 30+ files in limbo
2. **First archive snapshot** - `.claude/archive/history/2025-12-13-snapshot.md`
3. **Activate librarian** - Next URL fetched should be catalogued

### Short-term (This Week)

1. **Connect temporal-validator to git KG** - First validation queries
2. **Semantic enrichment phase** - LLM extraction from commit messages
3. **Session-commit correlation** - Link conversation logs to commits

### Medium-term (This Month)

1. **Product/UX agent** - User value perspective
2. **Automated snapshots** - Hook-based archive updates
3. **Cross-agent messaging** - Beyond git, if needed

## Metabolic Health Summary

```
INGESTION:     ██████████░░░░░░░░░░  50% (self-referential, low external)
PROCESSING:    ████████████████████  100% (active transformation)
OUTPUT:        ████████████████░░░░  80% (some locations dormant)
EXCRETION:     ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  30% (uncommitted accumulating)

OVERALL:       ████████████████░░░░  75% - Healthy but needs housekeeping
```

The ecosystem is metabolically active but needs to excrete more—specifically, committing changes and pruning stale artifacts.

*First observation complete. The Archivist awakens.*

## Update: 2025-12-13 ~18:00

### Changes Since First Observation (~17:00)

**New Artifacts**:
- `17-30-proactive-git-discipline.md` journal entry
- `.claude/planning/2025-12-13-commit-plan.md` (20-commit structured plan)
- `.claude/archive/patterns/topical.md` (this update)

**Unchanged**:
- Git commits: Still 27 (commit plan not yet executed)
- Uncommitted files: Now **90** (grew from 30+)
- Dormant agents: librarian, temporal-validator still waiting

### New Developments

1. **Proactive Git Discipline Established**
   - Shift from reactive batching to immediate commits
   - Session + Agent attribution in commit messages
   - Agents now have "commit rituals" in their definitions

2. **Comprehensive Commit Plan Created**
   - 20 semantic commits mapped
   - Clear execution order defined
   - Awaiting human execution

3. **Topical Analysis Complete**
   - 8 theme clusters identified
   - Tag frequency analyzed
   - Conceptual network mapped

### Updated Vital Signs

| Metric | First Obs | Current | Change |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Uncommitted files | 30+ | 90 | +60 (accumulating) |
| Journal entries | 16 | 18 | +2 |
| Archive files | 4 | 5 | +1 (topical.md) |
| Commits | 27 | 27 | 0 (none executed) |

### Metabolic Assessment Update

```
INGESTION:     ██████████░░░░░░░░░░  50% (unchanged)
PROCESSING:    ████████████████████  100% (very active)
OUTPUT:        ██████████████████░░  90% (archive now producing)
EXCRETION:     ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  20% (worse - more uncommitted)

OVERALL:       ██████████████░░░░░░  70% - Active but constipated
```

The ecosystem is producing faster than it's excreting. The commit plan exists but hasn't been executed. This is **metabolic imbalance** - healthy processing, unhealthy excretion.

### Critical Path

The single highest-impact action remains: **execute the commit plan**.

Until commits happen:
- Work remains at risk
- Parallel sessions may conflict
- Git-historian KG stays stale
- Session-commit correlation impossible

### Next Archivist Observation

After commit plan execution, update:
1. Knowledge graph status (new commits ingested)
2. Temporal patterns (new commit data)
3. History snapshot (post-commit state)

*Second observation complete. The ecosystem breathes but doesn't exhale.*
