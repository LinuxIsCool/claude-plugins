## Theme Clusters

Analysis of 18 journal atomic entries and planning documents reveals distinct conceptual clusters.

### Cluster 1: Agent Architecture (High Activity)

**Tags**: `agents`, `architecture`, `emergence`, `meta-cognition`, `registry`

**Related Artifacts**:
- `.claude/agents/` (8 agent definitions)
- `.claude/registry/agents.md`
- Journal: `15-15-agent-architecture-emerges`, `15-30-process-cartographer-activated`

**Theme**: The ecosystem is becoming self-aware through specialized agents. The agent-architect observes agents, the archivist observes flows, the process-cartographer maps workflows.

**Pattern**: Agents emerged through necessity, not planning. Each filled a gap when it became apparent.

---

### Cluster 2: Git as Coordination Layer (High Activity)

**Tags**: `git`, `coordination`, `conventions`, `commits`, `discipline`

**Related Artifacts**:
- `.claude/conventions/coordination.md`
- `.claude/planning/2025-12-13-commit-plan.md`
- Journal: `16-40-git-coordination-conventions`, `17-30-proactive-git-discipline`

**Theme**: Git is not just version control but the nervous system of the ecosystem. Commits are communication. Sessions coordinate through filesystem observation.

**Pattern**: Evolved from passive storage to active coordination layer in a single day.

---

### Cluster 3: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (Medium Activity)

**Tags**: `temporal-kg`, `knowledge-graph`, `git-historian`, `analysis`, `quality`

**Related Artifacts**:
- FalkorDB `git_history` graph
- `.claude/agents/git-historian.md`
- `.claude/agents/temporal-validator.md`
- Journal: `16-56-git-historian-born`, `17-00-git-archaeology-revelation`

**Theme**: History as queryable structure. Git commits become nodes, relationships become edges, quality becomes measurable.

**Pattern**: Moving from flat logs to graph-structured temporal knowledge.

---

### Cluster 4: Historical Archaeology (Medium Activity)

**Tags**: `archaeology`, `discovery`, `archivist`, `librarian`, `backfill`

**Related Artifacts**:
- `.claude/archive/` (this directory)
- `.claude/agents/archivist.md`, `librarian.md`
- Journal: `16-00-historical-archaeology-process`, `16-50-historical-archaeology-discovery`

**Theme**: The past contains valuable atomic entries. Session logs from Dec 8-13 hold undiscovered insights waiting for extraction.

**Pattern**: Two-phase approach - first map what exists, then synthesize insights.

---

### Cluster 5: Journal/Zettelkasten Model (Medium Activity)

**Tags**: `journal`, `atomic`, `obsidian`, `zettelkasten`, `graph`

**Related Artifacts**:
- `.claude/journal/` (20 markdown files)
- `plugins/journal/`
- Journal: `15-45-journal-atomic-model`

**Theme**: Atomic-first journal design. Small, focused entries link to form larger understanding.

**Pattern**: Daily notes aggregate atomics. Monthly notes aggregate dailies. Graph emerges from links.

---

### Cluster 6: Plugin Architecture (Medium Activity)

**Tags**: `plugins`, `skills`, `discovery`, `master-skill`

**Related Artifacts**:
- `plugins/` (12 plugin directories)
- `CLAUDE.md` (master skill pattern)
- Journal: `151500-plugin-agents-discovery`

**Theme**: Master skill pattern prevents truncation. Plugins can ship their own agents.

**Pattern**: Progressive disclosure - one master skill exposes many sub-skills.

---

### Cluster 7: Process Mapping (Low Activity)

**Tags**: `processes`, `mapping`, `cartography`

**Related Artifacts**:
- `.claude/registry/processes.md`
- `.claude/agents/process-cartographer.md`

**Theme**: Making invisible workflows visible. Information flows, reward systems, learning loops.

**Pattern**: Single mapping event established 8 core processes. More mapping needed.

---

### Cluster 8: Tooling/Infrastructure (Low Activity)

**Tags**: `obsidian`, `tooling`, `infrastructure`, `cli`

**Related Artifacts**:
- Journal: `14-30-subagent-exploration`, `16-20-obsidian-hidden-files`

**Theme**: Discovering and configuring the substrate.

**Pattern**: Infrastructure work happens in bursts when needs arise.

## Theme Evolution

### Morning (14:00-15:30)
Focus: **Discovery**
- Subagent capabilities
- Multi-persona reflection
- Agent architecture emergence

### Afternoon (15:30-16:30)
Focus: **Structure**
- Process mapping
- Journal redesign
- Historical archaeology planning

### Evening (16:30-17:30)
Focus: **Coordination**
- Git conventions
- Git historian
- Archivist activation
- Proactive commit discipline

**Pattern**: Evolution from "what can we do?" to "how do we organize?" to "how do we persist?"

All clusters connect through the central insight: **the ecosystem must be self-aware to coordinate**.

## Emerging Themes (Not Yet Clustered)

1. **AgentNet/Social Network** - Mentioned in planning but not yet in journal
2. **Product Development** - Implicit in backlog but not tagged
3. **Financial Metabolism** - Conceptually discussed, not yet instantiated

---

## Questions Raised by Themes

1. Why is "security" absent from all tags?
2. Why no "testing" or "quality" tags (beyond git quality)?
3. Will "AgentNet" become a major cluster?
4. How will clusters evolve as commits happen?

*Topical patterns will be updated as themes evolve.*
