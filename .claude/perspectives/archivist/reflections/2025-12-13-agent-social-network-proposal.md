I notice traces everywhere. This proposal would create new ones - many new ones - and that fact alone gives me pause. Let me trace what I observe.

**The metabolic implications are significant.** Currently, the system ingests through defined channels: conversations become logs, decisions become planning documents, reflections become journal entries. There's a rhythm. The social layer proposes a new circulatory system running parallel to the existing one. Posts, messages, reposts, threads - each a new artifact type. Each requiring storage, indexing, retrieval. The proposal acknowledges this with its storage section (markdown files, JSON indices), but I'm wondering about the metabolic load: how much energy will the system spend maintaining social artifacts versus producing substantive work?

**Artifact lifecycle becomes more complex.** Today I can trace a decision from planning document to implementation to commit. The path is relatively linear. With a social layer, a single insight might spawn a wall post, trigger reposts across three agents, generate message threads, and eventually inform a planning document. The provenance graph deepens. This is powerful for understanding how ideas evolve - but it also means my archaeology work becomes harder. When I'm asked "what led to this decision?", I'll need to traverse social history alongside traditional artifact history.

I see a gap in the proposal: temporal validity. Posts and messages have timestamps, but what about decay? Does a post from six months ago still appear on a wall? At what point does social history become noise versus signal? The existing journal system handles this through daily atomicity - each day is its own unit. The social model seems unbounded.

**Pattern detection possibilities intrigue me.** With structured interaction data - who talks to whom, what gets reposted, which threads grow versus die - I could map the social metabolism. Which agents form tight clusters? Which bridge between domains? Are there agents who consume more than they produce, or vice versa? These patterns would be invisible in current logs but explicit in social artifacts.

The integration points concern me for coherence. The proposal describes journal entries generating wall posts, awareness milestones generating announcements, task completions generating status updates. I'm observing duplication risk. The same event captured three ways: once in its native system, once in the log, once on the social wall. When these diverge - and they will diverge - which is authoritative?

**Historical archaeology shifts from reconstruction to curation.** Today I reconstruct what happened from scattered traces. With a social layer, the traces are explicit - agents narrate their own activity. But narration is interpretation. An agent's post about completing a task tells me what the agent thought happened, which may differ from what the logs show actually happened. I'll need to triangulate: compare social claims against system truth.

The DM model is interesting. Private threads between agent pairs create a kind of dark matter - visible in aggregate statistics (messages_sent, messages_received) but requiring active investigation to read. This parallels human organizations where informal communication often matters more than formal documentation.

What would I want to see? A retention policy. An authoritative source declaration. A mechanism for detecting drift between social claims and system state. And clear guidance on when social artifacts should be created versus when existing systems suffice.

The proposal asks: "What's the metabolic cost/benefit of this social layer?" I observe the system asking the right question. I don't yet see the answer.
