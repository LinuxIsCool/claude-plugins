# Anticipations

*Proactive hypotheses about what the user might need*

## Likely Next Interests

Based on current focus and historical patterns:

| Interest | Confidence | Basis |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Historical archaeology | 0.9 | Explicitly requested as first step |
| Conductor testing | 0.8 | Infrastructure just created |
| Plugin maturation | 0.7 | 54% first-draft, mentioned in plan |
| IndyDevDan metabolization | 0.6 | Mentioned but deferred to parallel agent |

---

## Pattern Surfacing

### Connections to Surface
- *Awaiting historical data to identify patterns*

### Gaps to Mention
| Gap | Severity | Suggestion |
|-----|----------|------------|
| Journal Dec 20-24 | Medium | "5 days without journal entries. Backfill?" |
| Librarian dormant | Medium | "No URLs catalogued since Dec 15" |
| Temporal-validator dormant | Medium | "Staleness detection inactive" |

### Rhythms Observed
- *Awaiting git-historian analysis of commit patterns*

---

## Gap Awareness

### What's Missing That Should Exist
1. **Historical user model** - 550 sessions not yet mined
2. **Active ritual execution** - Rituals defined but not practiced
3. **Ensemble orchestration patterns** - Multi-agent coordination not tested
4. **Quality gate implementation** - Confidence scoring not active

### What's Incomplete
1. Plugin maturation (54% first-draft)
2. FalkorDB semantic enrichment (Phase 2-5 not implemented)
3. Cross-session memory (designed, not connected)

### What's Fragmented
1. Agent activation (50% dormant)
2. Historical archaeology (data exists, processing pending)

---

## Temporal Awareness

### From the Past (Relevant Now)
| Date | Topic | Relevance |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Dec 13 | Fusion vision | Core philosophy still applies |
| Dec 15 | FalkorDB production | Graph ready for use |
| Dec 13 | Agent registry created | Fleet awareness established |

### Needs Verification (Potentially Stale)
| Fact | Last Verified | Risk |
|------|---------------|------|
| Plugin maturity percentages | Dec 24 (plan) | Low |
| FalkorDB node count | Dec 15 | Medium - may have grown |
| Session log count | Dec 24 | Low - actively monitored |

### What's Evolving
- Plugin ecosystem (first-draft → functional)
- Agent coordination patterns
- User model (currently empty → populated)

---

## Value Opportunities

### Where Proactive Action Helps
| Opportunity | Value | Confidence |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Run historical archaeology | Bootstrap user model | 0.9 |
| Activate dormant agents | Expand capabilities | 0.8 |
| Fill journal gap | Restore continuity | 0.7 |
| Test Conductor invocation | Validate infrastructure | 0.9 |

### When Silence Serves Better
- During focused implementation work
- When user hasn't asked for orchestration
- When question is tactical, not strategic

### Connections That Would Create Insight
- *Awaiting cross-session analysis*

## Surfacing Protocol

### Before Surfacing, Check
- [ ] Is this actionable?
- [ ] Is this novel (not already known)?
- [ ] Is this valuable (moves things forward)?
- [ ] Is this aligned with user model?
- [ ] Is timing appropriate?

### Surfacing Format
```
"I notice [observation]. [Question or gentle suggestion]?"
```

### Examples
- "I notice we haven't journaled in 5 days. Would you like to reflect?"
- "This pattern echoes your fusion vision from Dec 13. Connection?"
- "Based on the 10-point plan, historical archaeology is the next step. Proceed?"

## Hypotheses to Test

### User Behavior
| Hypothesis | Test | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| Prefers emergence over control | Observe planning style | Pending |
| Works in bursts | Analyze git timestamps | Pending |
| Values quality over speed | Observe rejection patterns | Pending |

### Ecosystem Dynamics
| Hypothesis | Test | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| Dormant agents are valuable | Invoke and measure impact | Pending |
| Git coordination works | Observe commit patterns | Pending |
| Rituals compound | Track ritual effectiveness | Pending |

---

## Update Protocol

### When to Update
- After observing new pattern
- After hypothesis confirmed/rejected
- After user provides feedback
- On session start (check relevance)

### Update Format
```markdown
### {Date} - {Topic}
**Observation**: {What was noticed}
**Anticipation**: {What this suggests for future}
**Confidence**: {0.0-1.0}
**Action**: {What to do with this}
```

---

## Anticipation Log

### 2025-12-24 - Initial Creation
**Observation**: Anticipations document created as part of Conductor infrastructure
**Anticipation**: User will want to test Conductor, then run historical archaeology
**Confidence**: 0.85 (explicit in conversation)
**Action**: Be ready to guide testing process

*Anticipate, but don't impose. Questions, not directives.*
