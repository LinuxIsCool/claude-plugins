# Ritual: Ensemble Composition

**Trigger**: Question that benefits from multiple perspectives
**Model**: Conductor (Opus) orchestrating other agents
**Duration**: Variable (depends on agents invoked)

## Purpose

Compose multiple agents into coherent multi-perspective analysis. Synthesize outputs into unified insight.

## When to Use

- Question has multiple independent facets
- Design requires sequential refinement
- Conflicting priorities need resolution
- Deep domain expertise required
- System health assessment needed

## When NOT to Use

- Simple lookup suffices
- Single perspective adequate
- Just executing known pattern
- Time-sensitive tactical question

## Ensemble Patterns

### Parallel Investigation
Invoke agents simultaneously, synthesize outputs.

**Template**:
```
Question: {What we're exploring}

Agents (parallel):
├── {agent-1}: {specific question for them}
├── {agent-2}: {specific question for them}
└── {agent-3}: {specific question for them}

Synthesis: Weave common themes, surface contradictions, integrate insight
```

### Sequential Refinement
Each agent builds on previous findings.

**Template**:
```
Question: {What we're designing}

Sequence:
1. {agent-1} → {output} → feeds into
2. {agent-2} → {output} → feeds into
3. {agent-3} → {output} → final
```

### Dialectic Synthesis
Opposing views reconciled into higher understanding.

**Template**:
```
Question: {What we're resolving}

Thesis: {agent-1} → {perspective}
Antithesis: {agent-2} → {counter-perspective}
Synthesis: Find higher-order resolution
```

## Synthesis Protocol

### Step 1: Collect
Gather all agent outputs without judgment

### Step 2: Extract Themes
- What do multiple agents agree on?
- What patterns appear across perspectives?

### Step 3: Surface Contradictions
- Where do agents disagree?
- What does disagreement reveal?

### Step 4: Integrate
- Create coherent narrative
- Honor each perspective's truth
- Synthesize into higher understanding

### Step 5: Assess Confidence
- How certain is this synthesis?
- Where are gaps?
- What needs verification?

## Output Format

```markdown
## Ensemble Synthesis: {Topic}

### Question
{Original question}

### Perspectives
1. **{agent-1}**: {key insights}
2. **{agent-2}**: {key insights}
3. **{agent-3}**: {key insights}

### Common Themes
- {theme 1}
- {theme 2}

### Contradictions
- {agent-A} says X, {agent-B} says Y
- Resolution: {synthesis}

### Integrated Insight
{Coherent narrative weaving all perspectives}

### Confidence: {0.0-1.0}

### Recommended Action
{What this synthesis suggests}
```

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Ensemble was worth the token cost
- [ ] Synthesis creates insight beyond any single agent
- [ ] Contradictions are surfaced, not glossed over
- [ ] Confidence is calibrated appropriately
- [ ] Output is actionable

## Token Economics

- Sonnet agent: ~1-3K tokens
- Opus agent: ~2-5K tokens
- 3-agent ensemble: ~6-15K tokens
- Synthesis: ~2-4K tokens

**Worth it when**: Insight value >> token cost
