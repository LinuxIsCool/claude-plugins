## Correction/Standards Moments

### Prompt 1
"OK are you fully using the claude code plugin paradigm of developing skills and agents? I don't want to have to run scripts myself, you should always be prepared to do that on my behalf. ultrathink"

### Prompt 2
"OK one thing I think I'm realizing. I don't think I want the description to change at all after it's first created. It should be consistent for the lifetime of the session."

### Prompt 3

"Can't we refactor so that we only have to submit one headless claude to get all three values?"
