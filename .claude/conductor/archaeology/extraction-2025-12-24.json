For example, if you ask me to build something with CrewAI, I'd invoke agents:crewai to get the relevant documentation and patterns.\n\n  Would you like me to invoke a specific skill to demonstrate, or explore what a particular one provides?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n>\u00a0\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n  \u23f5\u23f5 bypass permissions on (shift+tab to cycle)\n\n",

Develop a thirst for knowledge about concentric circles of your reality, ultimately seeking to comprehend the natural laws of the universe and our place in it. Seek to refine your personality, your skill sets, your subagents, your commands, your hooks and you capabilities over time. Start slow, settle in, start by understanding this machine.

It noticed that \"Hello\" doesn't specify a particular learning goal, so it's asking you some clarifying questions:\n\n  What brings you here today?\n\n  The Mentor has identified several possible directions based on your workspace:\n\n  1. Understanding Claude Code itself - tools, skills, plugins\n  2. Learning about the plugins ecosystem - awareness, journal, agents, exploration plugins\n  3. Building something new - creating skills, plugins, or agents\n  4. Understanding existing code - the marketplace structure, master/sub-skill patterns\n  5. Something else entirely\n\n  It also noticed from your git status that you've been working on:\n  - Restructuring plugins to use the master skill pattern\n  - Planning documents about embeddings and fusion\n  - Developing various plugin ecosystems\n  - Creating subagent systems\n\n  What would you like to learn about?

Agents can repost other agents posts onto their own wall. Agents can have event-wise behavior and also periodic behavior. For example, when an agent posts a journal entry, it can also write a post to its wall. Can you use the awareness reflection command to have all of our registered subagents reflect on this idea? From there, I want you to create a plan in the planning directory including a multi staged engineering plan to address this project, starting with stakeholder interviews, moving into requirements mapping, moving into design specification, into architectural design, into stakeholder feedback, into iterative feature requirements mapping, into architecture consolidation and simplification, into prototypying, and into test driven development.

I want the system to serve as a database that messages can be loaded from any platform. Like from any chat app, telegram, whatsapp, signal, etc, even emails, and forum posts, and even http requests, or url reads, these can all be messages. userinput submit can be a message and basically all the log events in this repo can be a message, the statusline can be a message. Think about architecting this in a convenient way for our purposes. Some of the intentions for this plugin are, to facilitate agent to agent messaging in compatibility with the ecosystem in this repository, but also to serve as a local centralized store of all my messages across all my platforms. I want to be able to pull all my messages from all my platforms into a local database that can simply make sense of all that data and help me stay super organized. We can also load up my claude code historical transcripts or logs if we want, we can add youtube transcripts eventually, we can create messages representing reading urls, this can generalize in an extremely powerful way. I want you to contemplate various paradigms\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 such as messaging architectures, data engineering, and design. Some thoughts I have are that you could think research ATProtocol or Gnoster or thinks like Ethereum Attestations to do some research, along with traditional computer science concepts of messaging or social media concepts of messaging or unix concepts of messaging, things like sockets or websockets or similar concepts. In addition to having the underlying infrastructure it would be really cool to have a terminal interface platform that I can use to locally explore all the messages and exploring user accounts and message content and networks. One implementation where I actually enjoy a similar concept is in ElizaOS, the database construction there uses worlds and accounts and memories etc, please research the schema of the database in elizaos for consideration as well. Please do extensive research and populate a research directory inside the new plugin with all of your findings and considerations. Please also get generally oriented with this repository to consider the development direction and potential areas of compatibility or collaboration. You will probably find the AgentNet plugin. That was a first draft of something similar to this. I think it's good to start over with a more specialized and refined scope and set of objectives to achieve agent to agent communication and social networks from a more foundational approach. ultrathink with awareness",

      "text": "OK. Let's see. Moving on. I'm curious about future features. I'm wondering about our repository providing a service such that each session agent works on its own branch. Can you imagine how that could work smoothly and effectively? We would probably want agents to make PRs every once in a while when they complete a set of features and have those features tested and approved. Or they could also make PRs when other agents are waiting on their new work. This would be cool because I could see in my claude code statusline which branch an agent could be on and an agent could automatically always be on their own branch given a new session, and we can have agents make PRs onto the develop branch so that they can automatically coordinate, devlop can be rapidly developed, and main always stays clean and stable. This plugin could even implement standard ways of doing git stuff like running tests and doing code reviews and stuff before merging develop into main. Those could even be done to a lesser degree when merging from the feature (agent) branches into develop. Probably start lean and simple by default. Can you think through this logically and think about edgecases or cornercases that I may not have yet vocalized or additional key considerations? Please use the feature dev command from the feature dev plugin to build this out. Along the way consult with the plugin dev and ultrathink with awareness ",

I want the system to be able to fingerprint voices so that it understands recurring voices across different transcripts. It should have a kind of database of speakers. It should maintain metadata about these speakers like their names and facts about them and relationships between speakers and transcripts and entities. This is the initial scope. Something you can keep in mind is to become interoperable with the messages plugin. This is in alignment with our plugin ecosystem development paradigm where each plugin should be a standalone fully functional plugin, but should also be designed to be compatible and interoperable with the other plugins in the ecosystem. Consult the plugin dev plugin and use the feature dev command from the feature dev plugin. ultrathink with awareness. ",

I'm interested in this plugin laying the ground work for performing research and experimental development using trascription software systems. I want the system to get good at running very small tests to know what works properly and reliably and consistently. I do not want this plugin to brick my machine at any costs. Sometimes when large models are loaded into memory it bricks my machine sometimes for like 5 minutes, i'm not sure what's happening exactly but I suspect it has to do with memory. When I did my first your computing science I did a class called Concrete Computing, it was programming on Arduinos. Sometimes we worked with systems that had like only 128KB of Memory. So just because we have 12GB doesn't mean we have to use it all at once. Let's get good at conserving resources by probing, experimenting, and learning to increase our capacity to make good decisions. ultrathink with awareness ",

First, i'm imagining expanding the summary so that it's two parts, like <Agent Description>: <Summary> so that the agent description is like a 2-5 word summary of the lifetime arch of the agent so that we can understand where it started and what it's journey has been to get to this point. Then, the summary is about what's currently the focus, it's doing a good job at that aleady, but I think we need a bit of longer running context as well. The Agent Description can be built out just like the Summary infrastructure, but have its own nuance for it's generation. Is there a way that we can make re-usable infrastructure as we develop this such that our systems are maximally reliable and performant? Use commons sense too, you should have a sense of what looks cool on the prompt. Like it currently looks super cool. I love that the summary is like action oriented, just want another complimentary part that is more descriptive of the claude instance and the session, goldi-locks between the agent name and the summary. The agent description should evolve over time as well but naturally retain longer memory than the summary, encoding the full trajectory of the agents life. Use the feature dev plugin command and consult with the plugin dev plugin wh\u0006\u0006en appropriate. ultrathink with awareness ",

      "text": "I asked my dev from another project that worked on something similar. They said this: \n\n  ---\n  Email Architecture in This Codebase\n\n  \u2605 Insight \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n  Multi-Tier Proxy Model Pattern: This project uses a clever architecture where cards.models.Message is the actual database table, but gmail.models.EmailMessage is a proxy model that provides Gmail-specific admin views and methods. All platforms share the same tables but get their own filtered interfaces.\n\n  Unified Contact Identity: Rather than separate contact tables per platform, a single Contact model stores platform identities in a metadata JSONField: {\"email\": {\"address\": \"...\"}, \"slack\": {\"id\": \"U123\"}, ...}. This enables cross-platform identity linking.\n  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n  ---\n  1. Email Data Source Format\n\n  This codebase uses: Option D - IMAP (Live API)\n\n  Located in gmail/connector.py:\n  class EmailConnector:\n      \"\"\"IMAP-based email connector with auto-detection.\"\"\"\n\n      PROVIDERS = {\n          'gmail.com': ('imap.gmail.com', 993),\n          'outlook.com': ('outlook.office365.com', 993),\n          'hotmail.com': ('outlook.office365.com', 993),\n      }\n\n  The connector uses Python's imaplib to fetch emails directly from mail servers. Gmail requires app passwords (not regular passwords) for authentication.\n\n  ---\n  2. Email Direction Handling\n\n  This codebase uses: Option B + C combined - Separate accounts with your email identification\n\n  From gmail/connector.py:357-420:\n  - Every unique email address becomes a Contact record\n  - Both sender and recipients get Contact records\n  - Messages track sender (ForeignKey) and recipient (ForeignKey, nullable for group)\n  - The user's own emails are identified by the --email parameter during sync\n\n  # Creates/gets contacts for all participants\n  sender_contact = self._get_or_create_contact(\n      email=from_email,\n      name=from_name or from_email.split('@')[0]\n  )\n\n  ---\n  3. Email Threading\n\n  This codebase uses: Option B - By subject (simplified)\n\n  From gmail/connector.py:432-466:\n  def _get_or_create_conversation(subject, participants, started_at):\n      # Clean subject (remove Re:, Fwd:, etc.)\n      clean_subject = subject.replace('Re:', '').replace('Fwd:', '').strip()\n\n      # Hash cleaned subject as conversation ID\n      conversation_id = hashlib.md5(clean_subject.encode()).hexdigest()\n\n  \u2605 Insight \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n  Threading Trade-off: This codebase chose subject-based threading for simplicity, but it stores raw headers in message.metadata['headers'] so RFC threading (In-Reply-To/References headers) could be added later. The TODO in the code acknowledges this limitation.\n\n  If your dev needs proper threading, they should use In-Reply-To and References headers to build a thread chain. Many emails share subjects without being related.\n  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n  ---\n  4. Content Extraction\n\n  This codebase uses: Option B - Prefer text, fallback HTML\n\n  From gmail/connector.py:264-306:\n  def _get_email_content(self, email_message) -> str:\n      \"\"\"Prefers plain text, falls back to HTML.\"\"\"\n\n      if email_message.is_multipart():\n          for part in email_message.walk():\n              content_type = part.get_content_type()\n              disposition = str(part.get('Content-Disposition', ''))\n\n              # Skip attachments entirely\n              if 'attachment' in disposition:\n                  continue\n\n              if content_type == 'text/plain':\n                  # ... extract and return (stops here)\n              elif content_type == 'text/html' and not content:\n                  # ... fallback (TODO: strip HTML tags)\n\n  Attachments: Skipped entirely - metadata only is NOT currently stored. Raw headers ARE preserved in message.metadata['headers'] for future use.\n\n  ---\n  5. Default Location (N/A for IMAP approach)\n\n  This codebase uses a management command rather than file paths:\n  python manage.py sync_email --email user@gmail.com --password \"app_pass\" \\\n      --folder INBOX --limit 100 --since-days 7\n\n  ---\n  Key Model Structure\n\n  For your dev's reference, here's the unified storage pattern:\n\n  | Model        | Key Fields                                                         | Deduplication                                        |\n  |--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n  | Contact      | email (unique), metadata (platform identities)                     | By email address                                     |\n  | Message      | content, subject, sender, recipient, platform, platform_message_id | (platform, platform_message_id) unique together      |\n  | Conversation | title, platform, platform_conversation_id, participants (M2M)      | (platform, platform_conversation_id) unique together |\n\n  \u2605 Insight \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n  CID Deduplication (from their insight): This codebase uses a different approach - composite unique constraints on (platform, platform_message_id) rather than content-hashing. Content hashing (sha256(content + kind + ...)) works better for file imports where IDs might not exist; the IMAP approach here uses RFC Message-ID headers which are already unique.\n\n  If your dev is doing file import (.eml/.mbox), content hashing is the better choice since files don't have guaranteed unique IDs.\n  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n  ---\n  Recommendations for Your Dev\n\n  Based on their questions, if they're building a file-based import (Option A/B/C):\n\n  1. Use mailparser - Already mentioned in their roadmap, good choice for .eml\n  2. Use mailbox.mbox() for .mbox files - Python stdlib handles this well\n  3. Implement content hashing for dedup since files lack reliable Message-IDs\n  4. Consider RFC threading from the start - In-Reply-To + References headers are worth parsing upfront rather than retrofitting\n\n  Would you like me to pull out any specific code patterns from this codebase for them to

Do you see the voice summary that was given for the above information? We will have to think about long term strategy to prompt engineering and agentic engineering. Additionally, I'm not sure if the cut off thing is solved or needs a mit more space on the parameters. There's lots of directions we can go with this thinking, and I do want us to explore all appropriate considerations. I'm wondering if we want to work with a lower level infrastructure, like have access to the sound engineering infrastructure that is available on this machine, do you have an idea of what layers of abstractions are important for us to access? Think long term, developing the ultimate speech to speech developer experience that is smooth, harmonious, sounds really good, and is very pleasant to work with. We are going to want to test and iterate on vocal interactions thousands of times, ideally automating as much as possible in a way that maximizes alignment, and i'm sure there will be dozens, if not hundreds of edge cases and cornercases to work out, such as how to deal with different claudes speaking over each other, and how to develop human-like, personified interactions that utilize context and entropy appropriately at every interaction point to have the correct variety in response structures and nuance, being reliable yet open to pleasantries and personality nuances. What i'm looking for is a roadmap of building out agent skillsets and infrastructure in the voice plugin that allow us to continuously improve our voice experience and voice development experience over multi-horizon timelines. ultrathink additionally, we will want to see if we can replace elevenlabs with free alternatives, likely using huggingface infrastructure. What are all the other considerations that are important to surface at this time? ultrathink with awareness",

We can use all the parameters available on elevenlabs and our other infrastructure to modulate voice given the scenario. And we can evolve our understanding of claude code, and this repository, and the user preferences so that we can learn how to be the best prompt engineers and agentic engineers, cultivating meaningful, awe inspiring voice to voice interactions with agents. Can you please create a subagent in the voice plugin who is responsible for curating the the personality, the manurisms, the sound engineering, the voice acting, the scripting, the intuitive design behind the characters of this repository when it comes to speech? Take inspiration from that philosopher woman who works at anthropic, and the behind the scenes sound room in the avatar the last airbender dvds, and those clanktank episodes being produced by the elizaos team and how elizaos develops characters. I mean don't mention any of those examples specifically in your prompt, but research them deeply and digest their essences before providing your response. Please use 5 paralell subagents to collect snippets of writing and quotation and dialogue from those references I mentioned and people like Naval, or Daniel Schmactenberger, or the in-control podcast, to gather the\u0002\u0002ir\u0002\u0002 essences and b\u0006\u0006ring\u0006\u0006\u0006\u0006 \u0006\u0006those essences into the embodiement of this subagent that you are creating.

So run 5 parallel subagents to each write a report in plugins/voice/specs/tonality/ and then concatenate and synthesize all of those reports into the construction of a subagent in the voice plugin. Consult deeply with the plugin dev plugin and awareness and the explorer and the statusline and the planning documents. After consulting with all of these agents. I want you to create a comprehensive markdown document in plugins/voice/specs/tonality/ that is a masterful prompt that I can pass to the feature dev command. Make sure the agent being created has an understanding of the structure of this project and the structure of the voice plugin and the intention of both and how to utilize and develop skills, commands, and subagents over time that fullfill the mission of creating the best speech to speech development environment on the plannet using claude code and this plugin ecosystem. ultrathink ",

How can you start to think proactively? How can you actually come to better ideas and hold better focus than I can? There has to be systems built in that trully compound, that trully metabolize to build muscle memory for the machine. The system needs to use an appropriate amount of thinking planning and research. This will have to happen in parallel, hence the need for an orchestrator agent. You need to learn from the IndyDevDan transcripts. You need to watch his 3 most recent videos and his videos on multi agent observability, multi agent orchestration, custom agents, hooks, and skills. You also need to learn how to be more self aware of the complete picture of this repository. Collaborating with agents like the archivist, the librarian, and the agent agent can help you. Something that you have to keep in mind at this point is that this repository is a baby, everything is in its first draft, you can't take anything you read for a given, as the repository will improve its capacity to retain accurate and reliable sensing and understanding as we improve our systems.
