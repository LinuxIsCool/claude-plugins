## Week of 2025-12-09

### Sessions

**2025-12-12: Initial Exploration (Plugin Creation)**
- Created exploration plugin with 6 skills
- Performed comprehensive environment survey
- Established baseline mastery levels

### Discoveries

1. **Substrate**: Running on Lenovo desktop (not System76 despite Pop!_OS) with i7-13700F, 32GB RAM, RTX 4070
2. **Tools**: Claude Code 2.0.67, 10 plugins, Python 3.13 + uv ecosystem
3. **Network**: 4 Docker containers providing graph/vector/time-series/cache infrastructure
4. **History**: Project evolved from brainstorm plugin (~Oct 2024) to full marketplace
5. **Location**: Vancouver, BC, Canada (PST timezone)

### Mastery Changes

| Circle | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Substrate | 0.0 | 0.55 | +0.55 |
| Tools | 0.0 | 0.45 | +0.45 |
| Network | 0.0 | 0.40 | +0.40 |
| History | 0.0 | 0.35 | +0.35 |
| Cosmos | 0.0 | 0.25 | +0.25 |

### Key Insights

1. This is a sophisticated AI/ML development environment with graph, vector, and time-series capabilities
2. The plugin ecosystem is designed for self-improvement and environmental literacy
3. The user (ygg) is an active Claude Code user (79 sessions) with a learning-focused approach
4. The concentric circles model maps well to actual environment structure

### Open Questions (Generated)

1. How are Docker containers orchestrated?
2. What data exists in Neo4j?
3. What's the full MCP tool inventory?
4. What agent frameworks are most relevant to this project?
5. What were the key decision points in project evolution?

### Cross-Circle Connections Noted

- **Substrate ↔ Network**: Docker containers consume host resources (RAM, CPU)
- **Tools ↔ Network**: MCP servers may use Docker databases
- **History ↔ Tools**: Plugin evolution shows tool adoption patterns
- **Substrate ↔ Cosmos**: Hardware embodies physical computation limits

### Next Week Focus

- Deep dive: Docker orchestration and data contents
- Goal: Network circle to Resident level (0.5+)
- Goal: Document first cross-circle connection in detail
