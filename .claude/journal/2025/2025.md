# 2025

## Vision

An ecosystem of intelligence that:
- Discovers and leverages available compute
- Learns about its environment and inhabitants
- Continuously improves goal achievement capacity
- Maintains coherence while scaling complexity
- Appears simple while being capable of depth

## Word of the Year

**Emergence**

What wants to exist will find its form. Design less, observe more. Let structure arise from need.

## Themes

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents with clear domains and relationships
- **Self-Organization**: Coordination through conventions, not protocols
- **Temporal Knowledge Graphs**: Truth tracked over time
- **Progressive Disclosure**: CLAUDE.md as routing table, not warehouse
- **Metabolic Intelligence**: Ingest, digest, integrate, excrete

## Quarterly Notes

### Q4 (Oct-Dec)

**December** — The architecture crystallizes
- [[2025-12]] — Agent ecosystem emergence

### Q3 (Jul-Sep)

*[To be filled]*

### Q2 (Apr-Jun)

*[To be filled]*

### Q1 (Jan-Mar)

*[To be filled]*

## Milestones

- [x] Seven custom agents established
- [x] Agent registry created
- [x] Process registry created
- [x] Multi-persona reflection system built
- [x] Parallel session coordination demonstrated
- [ ] Stewardship layer activated (librarian, archivist)
- [ ] Temporal KG infrastructure connected
- [ ] First autonomous agent workflows

## Annual Themes Emerging

### The Ecosystem Metaphor

The repository is alive. It has:
- **Metabolism**: Information flows in, gets processed, creates artifacts
- **Organs**: Agents with specialized functions
- **Nervous system**: Logging, awareness, meta-cognition
- **Memory**: Journal, knowledge graphs, git history
- **Immune system**: Temporal-validator checking for staleness

### The Coordination Discovery

Agents coordinate through:
- Shared filesystem conventions
- Git as observable message passing
- Registry files as ground truth
- Wikilinks as relationship encoding

No explicit messaging protocol needed. The medium is the message.

## Looking Forward

The skeleton is built. The organs exist. Activation awaits.

The next phase: breathing life into dormant agents, connecting to temporal infrastructure, observing what emerges when the system runs.
