# 2025-12-15 Monday

## Summary

A day of activation, not creation. Following the [[19-00-the-phase-transition|phase transition]] insight from Dec 13, we converted potential energy to kinetic by activating dormant capabilities.

## Atomic Entries

- [[19-30-activation-begins]] — Three activations: librarian, temporal-validator, semantic seeding

## What Happened

### Agents Activated

| Agent | Status Before | Status After | First Task |
|-------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Librarian | Dormant since Dec 13 | Active | Catalogued Graphiti |
| Temporal-Validator | Dormant since Dec 13 | Active | Verified master skill pattern |

### Layers Initialized

| Layer | Status Before | Status After |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Library | Empty | Index + 1 domain + 1 topic |
| Validation Registry | Non-existent | Created with VAL-001 |
| Concept Registry | Non-existent | 10 concepts seeded |

## Commits

- `[agent:librarian] activate: First resource catalogued`
- `[agent:temporal-validator] activate: First fact verification`
- `[semantic] seed: First concept extraction`
- `[journal] reflect: The Phase Transition`
- `[agent:archivist] assess: Multi-agent ecosystem assessment`

## Key Insight

> **Stop building. Start activating.**

Creating feels productive but accumulates potential energy.
Activating feels less exciting but creates actual value.

Today we activated. The ecosystem responded.

## Coherence Scores

| Dimension | Dec 13 | Dec 15 | Change |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Structural | 8/10 | 8/10 | — |
| Semantic | 5/10 | 5.5/10 | ↑ (concept registry) |
| External | 2/10 | 2.5/10 | ↑ (library started) |

## What's Next

1. Continue activation pattern
2. Ingest concepts to FalkorDB
3. Backfill library from session logs
4. Next validation: agent registry accuracy

*The phase transition advances. Structure becomes semantics.*
