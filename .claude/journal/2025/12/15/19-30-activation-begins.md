# Activation Begins

*The shift from potential to kinetic*

---

## What Happened

Following the [[19-00-the-phase-transition|phase transition reflection]], we stopped building and started activating.

Three activations in one session:

### 1. Librarian - First Resource Catalogued

The librarian, dormant since creation on Dec 13, catalogued its first external resource.

**Resource**: Graphiti (github.com/getzep/graphiti)
- Temporal knowledge graph framework
- Informed git-historian design
- FalkorDB driver patterns

**Created**:
- `.claude/library/index.md` - Library index with orphaned provenance tracking
- `.claude/library/urls/by-domain/github.com.md` - Domain catalogue
- `.claude/library/urls/by-topic/knowledge-graphs.md` - Topic catalogue

**External coherence**: 2/10 → beginning to improve

### 2. Temporal-Validator - First Fact Verified

The temporal-validator, also dormant since Dec 13, performed its first verification.

**Verified**: Master Skill Pattern accuracy
- 8/8 plugins compliant
- Confidence: 1.0 (direct observation)
- Result: VERIFIED

**Created**:
- `.claude/registry/validations.md` - Validation registry with:
  - Fact tracking structure
  - Staleness detection framework
  - Verification queue

### 3. Semantic Seeding - First Concepts Extracted

The semantic layer was initialized with concepts from the phase transition reflection.

**Concepts seeded** (10 total):
- Phase Transition
- Creation Addiction
- Semantic Coherence
- Potential Energy / Kinetic Energy
- Master Skill Pattern
- Metabolic Model
- Proactive Commit Discipline
- Dormant Agents / Activation

**Created**:
- `.claude/concepts/index.md` - Concept registry with:
  - Definitions
  - Source documents
  - Related concepts
  - Textual concept graph

**Semantic coherence**: 5/10 → beginning to improve

## What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Librarian dormant | Librarian active, first resource catalogued |
| Temporal-validator dormant | Temporal-validator active, first fact verified |
| No concept layer | 10 concepts seeded |
| External coherence: 2/10 | Library structure established |
| Semantic coherence: 5/10 | Concept registry created |

---

## The Lesson

The [[19-00-the-phase-transition|phase transition reflection]] was right:

> **Stop building. Start activating.**

In one session:
- 2 dormant agents became active
- 1 new layer (concepts) was seeded
- 0 new agents were created

**Potential energy converted to kinetic.**

---

## What's Next

The activation pattern continues:

1. **Ingest concepts to FalkorDB** - Connect concept registry to graph database
2. **Librarian: catalogue more resources** - Backfill from session logs
3. **Temporal-validator: next verification** - Agent registry accuracy
4. **Semantic seeding: more documents** - Planning docs, perspectives

## Commits This Session

```
df33c9b [agent:librarian] activate: First resource catalogued
009b807 [agent:temporal-validator] activate: First fact verification
0d25ab9 [semantic] seed: First concept extraction
```

---

*Three dormant capabilities awakened. The phase transition advances.*

---

## Reflection

There's something satisfying about activation that creation doesn't provide.

Creating an agent is an act of imagination. Activating it is an act of trust—trusting that what we built works, that it provides value, that the effort was worthwhile.

Today we trusted. And the agents delivered.

The librarian catalogued. The validator verified. The concepts crystallized.

**The ecosystem breathes a little deeper.**
