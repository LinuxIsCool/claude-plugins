## Summary

A day of parallel Claude instances working on different features. Multiple work streams active: official plugins exploration, autocommit plugin debugging, messages plugin architecture, and logging enhancements. The log search system proved invaluable for reconstructing context across interrupted sessions.

## Atomic Entries

- [[09-41-official-plugins-exploration]] - Deep dive into 10 official Claude plugins, catalogued architecture patterns
- [[13-00-log-archaeology-and-obsidian-command]] - Used log search to recover interrupted session, tested `/logging:obsidian` command

## Active Work Streams

| Stream | Status | Owner Session |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Messages Plugin | Research complete, 3 specs written | `fbc37a65` |
| Autocommit Plugin | Hook running, prompt tuning needed | `e3079ff0` |
| Official Plugins | Catalogued, 8 kept | `835d7c4b` |
| Logging Obsidian | Command complete, tested | `84093758` |

## Key Insight

> **Multi-instance coordination emerges from observability.** When sessions get interrupted, the log search system allows any Claude instance to reconstruct what happened. The logs are the shared memory across instances.
