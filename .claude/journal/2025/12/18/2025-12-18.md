## Summary

Morning session completing company plugin output style work. Late morning deep research into plugin caching mechanics—discovered why restart is required, activated dormant dev-tools plugin, created headless refresh mechanism. Afternoon: statusline identity hook work, then major breakthrough on GPU transcription—resolved cuDNN library path issue enabling CUDA acceleration, fixed ESM imports, installed pyannote-audio for speaker diarization. Evening: completed the full transcription pipeline integration—built PyAnnoteAdapter for speaker diarization, created TranscriptionService that combines faster-whisper + pyannote for speaker-attributed transcripts, achieving 23x realtime processing. Late evening: extended the pipeline with SQLite FTS5 search index for utterance-level full-text search, created TranscriptWorkflow orchestrator connecting transcription → storage → search indexing → automatic voice fingerprinting using 256-dim speaker embeddings from pyannote. Night: wired the search infrastructure to the MCP server—added three new tools (`transcripts_search`, `transcripts_search_stats`, `transcripts_rebuild_index`) exposing FTS5 full-text search with boolean operators, phrase matching, prefix wildcards, and speaker/transcript filtering.
