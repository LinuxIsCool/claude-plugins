## Summary

The marketplace transforms from logging infrastructure to full capability ecosystem. Three major plugins reach milestones, and the plugin count expands significantly.

## Timeline

| Time | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 17:01 | [[17-01-schedule-v1-release\|Schedule.md v1.0.0]] | First 1.0 release in marketplace |
| 17:28 | [[17-28-awareness-plugin-begins\|Awareness Development]] | Meta-cognitive plugin started |
| 19:09 | [[19-09-awareness-phase01-complete\|Awareness Phase 0+1]] | Core skills established |
| 19:11 | [[19-11-agents-llms-registered\|Agents + LLMs Plugins]] | Framework knowledge catalogued |
| 19:34 | [[19-34-journal-plugin-born\|Journal Plugin Born]] | Temporal memory system created |

## Key Artifacts Created

1. `plugins/Schedule.md/` - Full MCP-enabled scheduler (v1.0.0)
2. `plugins/awareness/` - Self-reflection capabilities
3. `plugins/agents/` - 18+ agent framework knowledge
4. `plugins/llms/` - LLM technology ecosystem
5. `plugins/journal/` - Obsidian-style linked documents

## Metrics

- **Commits**: 4 significant (74df7cd → b2cef6a)
- **Sessions logged**: 10
- **Plugins reaching milestone**: 4
- **Skills created**: 15+

## Themes

- **Capability explosion** - From 2 plugins to 6+
- **Meta-cognition** - Awareness plugin enables self-reflection
- **Temporal memory** - Journal provides history mechanism
- **Knowledge curation** - Agents/LLMs catalog expertise

## Reflection

Day three transformed infrastructure into capability. The ecosystem gained eyes (awareness), memory (journal), and knowledge (agents/llms). The skeleton acquired organs.

## Key Patterns Established

1. **Master skill architecture** - Progressive disclosure
2. **Wikilinks as graph** - Links create connections
3. **MCP integration** - Tools via servers
4. **Atomic-first journal** - Small truths synthesize
