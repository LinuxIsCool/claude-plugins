# Awareness Plugin: Phase 0+1 Complete

## Event

```
git commit -m "feat: Add awareness ecosystem (Phase 0+1 complete)"
```

## What Was Built

**Phase 0: Foundation**
- Plugin manifest and structure
- Core skills architecture
- /learn command

**Phase 1: Core Skills**
- `docs-reader` - Read and understand documentation
- `guide-utilizer` - Apply guides and tutorials
- `techniques` - Advanced technique application

## The /learn Command

```markdown
/awareness:learn [topic]
```

Begins a structured learning session with:
- Documentation fetching
- Guide application
- Technique practice
- Reflection and synthesis

## Significance

The awareness plugin established the pattern of **skills as capabilities**:
- Skills are discovered, not commanded
- Progressive disclosure (master → sub-skills)
- Agent autonomy in tool selection

## What Remained

- Phase 2: Integration with other plugins
- Phase 3: Memory persistence
- Phase 4: Self-improvement loops

(Some of these would be addressed via the ecosystem activation work on Dec 15)
