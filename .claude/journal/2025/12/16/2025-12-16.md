## Summary

A day of infrastructure plugins. Built the temporal plugin (timestamp injection, The Chronologist persona) with an expanded vision for calendars, astronomy, and historical chronology. Also built the statusline plugin for Claude instance identity with hooks, registry, and self-naming.

## Atomic Entries

- [[08-43-temporal-plugin-born]] — Birth of temporal plugin and The Chronologist's expanded vision (calendars, astronomy, history)
- [[14-00-statusline-plugin-complete]] — Full statusline plugin with auto-registration, self-naming, and hook-based session tracking
- [[21-00-activation-session-complete]] — Ecosystem activation: archivist/librarian active, archaeology complete, persona memory validated

## What Happened

### Plugin Created

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `session-start.sh` hook | Auto-registers on SessionStart, exports $SESSION_ID |
| `statusline.sh` | Renders `[Opus:abc12] dir | ctx:42% | $0.45` |
| `registry.py` | Python module for instance tracking |
| Self-naming skill | Guides Claude on when/how to name itself |
| `/statusline:install` | One-command setup |
| `/statusline:instances` | List all tracked instances |

### Technical Discoveries

1. **SessionStart hook receives JSON** with `session_id`, `cwd`, `source`
2. **CLAUDE_ENV_FILE** allows hooks to persist environment variables for the session
3. **Hook stdout** becomes context injected into Claude's awareness
4. **current_usage field** in statusline JSON provides accurate context percentage

### Format Evolution

| Iteration | Format | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `[Explorer:a1b2c]` | Good for custom names |
| 2 | `[Claude-a1b2c:a1b2c]` | Redundant without custom name |
| 3 | `[Opus:a1b2c]` | Clean - model name + short ID |

User feedback drove the refinement: "What's with the dbaaa?"

## Commits

- (pending) feat(statusline): Add instance identity plugin with hooks and registry

## Key Insight

> **The statusline is the surface. The registry is the memory. The hooks are the nervous system.**

Together they transform Claude from an anonymous process into an identifiable agent with persistent identity across context resets.

## Plugin Ecosystem Status

Now 15 plugins in the marketplace:
1. brainstorm
2. logging
3. awareness
4. schedule
5. agents
6. llms
7. backlog
8. journal
9. knowledge-graphs
10. exploration
11. interface
12. agentnet
13. temporal
14. **statusline** ← new

## What's Next

1. Test in production with multiple parallel Claude sessions
2. Add message passing between instances
3. Historical queries: "What did Explorer work on?"
4. Automatic task detection for name suggestions

*From exploration to implementation. Identity emerges.*
