# Marketplace Genesis

## Event

The Claude Code plugin marketplace repository is created with its first plugin: brainstorm.

```
git init
git commit -m "Initialize marketplace with brainstorm plugin."
```

## Significance

This marks the birth of the entire ecosystem. A single seed - the brainstorm plugin - planted in what will become a forest of agents, plugins, and interconnected systems.

## Artifacts

- `plugins/brainstorm/` - First plugin directory
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` - Marketplace manifest
- Initial repository structure established

## What Came Next

This simple beginning would expand within days to include logging, scheduling, awareness, agents, and a full cognitive ecosystem.
