# Zero Truncation Policy Established

## Event

CLAUDE.md is created with a foundational principle that will shape all subsequent development:

> "NEVER truncate data. Truncating data in code causes silent data loss."

## The Philosophy

This isn't just a coding guideline - it's a statement about information integrity. Data is sacred. Context matters. What you discard might be what you needed.

## Significance

This principle would later extend to:
- Logging plugin (full-fidelity session capture)
- Journal system (atomic-first, nothing lost)
- Archive philosophy (observe patterns, don't discard)

## The Full Mandate

```markdown
NEVER truncate data. Truncating data in code causes silent data loss.
NEVER add hard-coded data to documents. Data will typically change.
Produce clean, reliable, maintainable code that maximizes quality
while minimizing lines of code, rigidity, and fragility.
```

## Artifacts

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions established
