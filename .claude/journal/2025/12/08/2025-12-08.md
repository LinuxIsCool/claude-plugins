*Reconstructed via historical archaeology on Dec 15, 2025*

## Summary

The day the marketplace was born. From a single commit at 13:19 to 21:00, an entire logging infrastructure was built.

## Timeline

| Time | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 13:19 | [[13-19-marketplace-genesis\|Marketplace Genesis]] | Repository initialized with brainstorm plugin |
| 14:53 | [[14-53-zero-truncation-policy\|Zero Truncation Policy]] | CLAUDE.md philosophy established |
| 15:19-17:58 | [[15-19-logging-plugin-begins\|Logging Plugin Development]] | 12 commits, full-fidelity capture built |
| 17:48 | [[17-48-hot-reload-research\|Hot Reload Research]] | 5 parallel subagents explore DX |
| 21:00 | Code formatting | Day concludes |

## Key Artifacts Created

1. `plugins/brainstorm/` - First plugin
2. `plugins/logging/` - Session capture system
3. `CLAUDE.md` - Core principles
4. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` - Marketplace manifest

## Metrics

- **Commits**: 18 (e0621bd → 332efa8)
- **Sessions logged**: 17
- **Plugins created**: 2 (brainstorm, logging)
- **Principles established**: Zero truncation, clean code, no hard-coded data

## Themes

- **Foundation laying** - Core infrastructure built
- **Rapid iteration** - Logging plugin evolved through 12 commits
- **Quality over speed** - Zero truncation enforced from day one

## Reflection

Day one established patterns that would persist: markdown-native approaches, full-fidelity capture, parallel exploration. The ecosystem's DNA was written.
