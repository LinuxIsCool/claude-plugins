## Themes

- **Agent Architecture**: Building the multi-agent cognitive ecosystem
- **Emergence**: Discovering what wants to exist rather than designing top-down
- **Meta-Cognition**: The ecosystem becoming aware of itself
- **Self-Organization**: Parallel sessions coordinating through filesystem
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Appearing small while being capable of depth

## Progress

### Week of Dec 8-14

**Dec 13**: Major architectural work across parallel sessions

Two independent sessions worked on the same ecosystem:

| Session A | Session B |
|-----------|-----------|
| /reflect-on command | Strategic synthesis |
| backend-architect, systems-thinker | librarian, archivist |
| agent-architect (initial) | agent-architect (enhanced) |
| process-cartographer | Five Core Primitives |
| temporal-validator | Strategic briefing |

Neither knew what the other built until git/filesystem revealed it. This validated the insight that **emergence beats design**.

### Artifacts Created This Month

**Agents (7)**
- backend-architect — Infrastructure perspective
- systems-thinker — Complexity/dynamics perspective
- agent-architect — Fleet management and meta-awareness
- process-cartographer — Workflow and information flow mapping
- temporal-validator — Data verification and temporal KG
- librarian — External resource curation
- archivist — Internal artifact observation

**Registries**
- `.claude/registry/agents.md` — Fleet catalogue
- `.claude/registry/processes.md` — Process mapping

**Commands**
- `/reflect-on` — Multi-persona document reflection

**Infrastructure**
- `.claude/perspectives/` — Agent output namespaces
- `.claude/library/` — Librarian's workspace (dormant)
- `.claude/archive/` — Archivist's workspace (dormant)

## Insights

### Five Core Primitives (from fusion synthesis)

| Primitive | Essence |
|-----------|---------|
| Context as Currency | Every token has cost; CLAUDE.md as routing table |
| Network of Networks | Heterogeneous graphs with multiple edge types |
| Temporal-Spatial Dimensions | Knowledge has coordinates in time and space |
| Metabolic Intelligence | Ingest, digest, integrate, excrete |
| Financial Metabolism | Agents have budgets; value creates survival |

### Key Discovery

**Git + conventions > complex protocols**

Inter-agent communication happens organically through:
- Git commits as observable messages
- Shared file locations as coordination points
- Commands as orchestration mechanisms

### Three-Layer Architecture

```
Meta Layer      → agent-architect (who exists)
                → archivist (what flows)
                → process-cartographer (how it flows)
                → temporal-validator (is it true)

Interface       → librarian (external resources)

Perspective     → backend-architect, systems-thinker, ...
```

## What's Working

- Namespace organization (Grade A)
- Agent definition pattern (YAML frontmatter + system prompt)
- Registry pattern (centralized index, progressive disclosure)
- Parallel session coordination via filesystem
- Journal as cross-session memory

## What Needs Attention

- Dormant agents need activation (librarian, archivist, temporal-validator)
- Temporal KG infrastructure not yet connected
- /reflect-on could use true subagent isolation
- Monthly/yearly journal hierarchy needs establishment

## Daily Notes

- [[2025-12-08]] — Genesis day (marketplace created, logging plugin built)
- [[2025-12-11]] — Expansion day (Schedule v1.0, awareness, journal plugins)
- [[2025-12-12]] — Contemplation day (version control, persona strategy begins)
- [[2025-12-13]] — Architectural emergence day
- [[2025-12-15]] — Activation day (archivist, librarian, archaeology)
