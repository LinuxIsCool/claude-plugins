# Agent Architecture Emerges

The meta-layer crystallized: agent-architect for fleet management, discovery of parallel session's work, taxonomy classification.

## Context

Needed a meta-agent to track the growing fleet. Created agent-architect, then discovered another session had already created librarian and archivist agents.

## What Was Created

### Agent Architect

`.claude/agents/agent-architect.md`:
- Meta-agent for fleet awareness
- Maintains `.claude/registry/agents.md`
- Tracks states, capacities, relationships
- Key question: "What exists, and how does it relate?"

### Agent Registry

`.claude/registry/agents.md`:
- 7 custom agents catalogued
- 10 plugin personas documented
- 5 built-in agents listed
- Taxonomy diagrams
- Gap analysis

### Taxonomy Discovered

```
Agent Types
├── Perspective Agents (backend-architect, systems-thinker)
├── Meta Agents (agent-architect)
├── Operational Agents (process-cartographer, temporal-validator)
└── Stewardship Agents (librarian, archivist)
```

## The Emergence Event

Two parallel sessions built complementary pieces:

| Session A | Session B |
|-----------|-----------|
| agent-architect | librarian |
| process-cartographer | archivist |
| temporal-validator | Enhanced agent-architect |
| /reflect-on command | Strategic briefing |

Neither knew what the other built. Git + filesystem revealed it.

## Insight

**Emergence beats design.** The structure that wanted to exist... existed. We each found our part.
