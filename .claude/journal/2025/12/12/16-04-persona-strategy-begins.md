# Persona Subagents Strategy Begins

## Event

User initiates the persona subagents exploration:

> "I want you to broadly study the personalities and capabilities being developed in this repository. I want to consult with each of the plugins in consideration of the following development, we are to build a subagent for each plugin to create the persona for that plugin..."

## The Vision

Build ambassador agents for each plugin:
- Full knowledge of their plugin's trajectory
- Long-term persistent memory
- Agentic qualities (proactive, self-improving)
- Inter-agent collaboration

## Initial Research

Two parallel explorations launched:
1. **Plugin architecture study** - Understanding all 10 plugins
2. **Agent framework study** - Memory systems, frameworks

## Key Findings

**Plugins identified** (10):
- brainstorm, logging, awareness, schedule
- agents, llms, backlog, journal
- knowledge-graphs, exploration

**Memory options explored**:
- Letta (MemGPT) - Self-editing memory
- Mem0 - Automatic fact extraction
- Graphiti - Temporal knowledge graphs
- FalkorDB - Graph database

## Initial Strategy Drafted

Document created: `PERSONA_SUBAGENTS_STRATEGY.md`
- Persona profiles for all plugins
- Architecture recommendations
- Implementation phases

## What Changed Later

On Dec 15, discovery that the persona architecture already existed:
- 11 plugin personas catalogued in registry
- Agent infrastructure built
- Archive/Library/Journal ready

Strategy pivoted from "build" to "activate".
