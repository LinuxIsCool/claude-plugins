> All tasks complete. Here's what was done to make the graph more complete:
> 
> **Footers Added** (19 atomic entries):
> - Dec 08: 4 entries (marketplace-genesis, zero-truncation, logging-begins, hot-reload)
> - Dec 11: 5 entries (schedule-v1, awareness-begins, phase01-complete, agents-llms, journal-born)
> - Dec 12: 3 entries (version-control, awareness-lens, persona-strategy)
> - Dec 13: 1 entry (plugin-agents-discovery)
> - Dec 15: 6 entries (phase-transition, remediation, personas-complete, activation-begins, coordinator-preferences, awareness-reflection)
> 
> **Pattern Used**:
> ```markdown
> ---
> 
> *Parent: [[YYYY-MM-DD]] → [[YYYY-MM]] → [[YYYY]]*
> ```
> 
> **Documentation Updated**:
> - Added pre-flight checklist item for footers
> - Added "Body Links for Graph Connectivity" section explaining:
>   - Frontmatter links are NOT crawled by Quartz/Obsidian
>   - Body footers required for atomic entries
>   - Nav bars required for daily/monthly/yearly
> 
> The Quartz server should detect these changes and rebuild. The graph should now show proper parent-child connections between all atomic entries and their daily summaries.
