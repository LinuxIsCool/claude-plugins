> 1. Is there a token limit for the skills list?
> 2. How are skills prioritized when truncation occurs?

<details>
<summary>`15:26:31` 🌲 Claude</summary>

> Based on my research, here's what's happening:
> 
> ## Skill Truncation Mechanism
> 
> **The truncation is internal to Claude Code** - it's part of how the system prompt is assembled at session startup.
> 
> ### How it works:
> 1. Claude Code loads all available skills from enabled plugins
> 2. Each skill's name + description consumes tokens in the system prompt
> 3. When a token budget is exceeded, the list is cut
> 4. You see: `<!-- Showing 45 of 84 skills due to token limits -->`
> 
> ### Prioritization
> The exact algorithm isn't documented, but appears to follow:
> 1. Plugin registration order in `marketplace.json`
> 2. Skills within each plugin (alphabetical or discovery order)
> 
> Looking at your marketplace.json order:
> ```
> brainstorm → logging → awareness → schedule → agents → llms → backlog → journal
> ```
> 
> Yet displayed skills come from: logging, schedule, agents, llms - **skipping awareness, backlog, journal**. This suggests there may be additional prioritization beyond registration order.
> 
> ### No User Configuration
> There's **no documented setting** to control which skills appear in the truncated list. Options to reduce truncation:
> - Disable unused plugins in `settings.json`
> - Reduce total skill count
> - Consolidate skills
> 
> ### Key Insight
> **Skills still work even when not displayed** - as we demonstrated with `awareness:docs-reader`. The truncation only affects the initial display, not functionality.
> 
> Would you like me to investigate the Claude Code source or plugin loader to find the exact truncation logic?

> How did it go?

<details>
<summary>`15:49:15` 🌲 Claude</summary>

> ## Investigation Complete - Here's What I Found
> 
> ### The Root Cause: 15,000 Character Budget
> 
> Skills are **not in the system prompt** directly. They're in the **Skill tool's description** within the tools array. Claude Code enforces a **15,000 character budget** for the `<available_skills>` section.
> 
> ### The Truncation Algorithm (Flawed)
> 
> According to [GitHub Issue #13343](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13343):
> 
> 1. **Prioritizes by description length** - Longer descriptions get included first
> 2. **Penalizes concise writing** - Well-written short descriptions get truncated
> 3. **No semantic relevance** - Doesn't consider what's useful for the current task
> 
> Example from the issue:
> ```
> 526 chars - Hook Development       ✓ Included (verbose)
> 117 chars - jq                     ✗ Truncated (concise)
> 117 chars - yq                     ✗ Truncated (concise)
> ```
> 
> ### Known Bugs (Two Related Issues)
> 
> | Issue | Problem |
> |-------|---------|
> | [#13343](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13343) | Skills truncated at ~30, remaining undiscoverable |
> | [#13344](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13344) | Plugin enable/disable ignored - all skills load regardless |
> 
> ### Why Your Awareness Skills Don't Show
> 
> Your awareness skills have **concise descriptions** (~150-200 chars), while agents/llms skills have **verbose descriptions** (~400-500 chars). The algorithm favors verbosity.
> 
> ### No User Configuration Available
> 
> There's no environment variable or setting to:
> - Change the 15,000 character budget
> - Override the prioritization algorithm
> - Force specific skills to appear
> 
> ### Proposed Fixes (From GitHub)
> 
> 1. **Raise the limit** - 84 skills at ~200 chars each = ~17k chars (close to limit)
> 2. **Smart truncation** - Prioritize by relevance to current prompt
> 3. **Minimal fallback** - Show just skill names for truncated skills so Claude knows they exist
> 
> ### Workaround
> 
> Skills still **work when invoked by name** even if not displayed - as we proved with `awareness:docs-reader`.
>

> ## Here's the Math
> 
> ### Description Characters Only
> | Plugin | Skills | Chars |
> |--------|--------|-------|
> | knowledge-graphs | 17 | 4,420 |
> | awareness | 8 | 3,267 |
> | agents | 18 | 3,219 |

> 
> ### But There's Overhead!
> 
> Each skill entry in `<available_skills>` has XML structure:
> ```xml

> TOTAL:            ~27,000 chars
> ```
> 
> **You're at nearly 2× the 15,000 character budget!**
> 
> ### Why This Happened
> 
> 1. **knowledge-graphs** alone adds 17 skills (4,420 chars + overhead)
> 2. **agents** has 18 skills with verbose descriptions
> 3. **awareness** has 8 skills including many with placeholder/template text
> 4. Skills are **duplicated** - I saw some appear twice in my available_skills list
> 
> ### Solutions
> 
> 1. **Consolidate skills** - Fewer, more comprehensive skills
> 2. **Shorten descriptions** - Many are verbose or placeholders
> 3. **Disable unused plugins** - Remove entire plugin categories you don't need
> 4. **Clean up templates** - Several awareness skills have unfilled template descriptions like `"Analyze code for [specific aspect]. Use when..."`
> 
> Would you like me to identify which specific skills have placeholder descriptions that should be removed or fixed?

> Let's use the progressive disclosure concept of skills so that we have a much smaller initial footprint. So a lot of the top level skills shouldn't be top level skills, they should be discoverable skills. Each plugin should have just one master skill that has a summary of all the subskills it has access to. When deeper skills are needed the higher level skills can be invoked to learn more about those subskills. Do you understand what i'm saying? ultrathink

> 1. **Option preference?** A (rename), B (embed), or C (resource loading)?
> 2. **Should sub-skills remain directly invokable?** (e.g., `agents:crewai` still works if you know the name)
> 3. **Start with one plugin as proof-of-concept?** (I'd suggest `awareness` since it's yours)

> I think C makes the most sense. 2. I guess yeah if there is a clean architecture for that. 3. Sure start with one for proof of concept.

> ## Proof of Concept Complete
> 
> ### New Structure
> ```
> plugins/awareness/skills/
> ├── awareness/                    # Master skill (DISCOVERABLE)
> │   ├── SKILL.md                  # 330 chars description
> │   └── subskills/                # Sub-skills (NOT auto-discovered)
> │       ├── docs-reader.md
> │       ├── guide-utilizer.md
> │       ├── techniques.md
> │       ├── skill-creator.md
> │       ├── plugin-studier.md
> │       ├── resource-studier.md
> │       ├── agent-creator.md
> │       └── temporal-kg-memory.md
> └── temporal-kg-memory/           # Supporting files preserved
>     ├── tools/
>     ├── hooks/
>     └── queries/
> ```
> 
> ### Impact
> 
> | Metric | Before | After | Reduction |
> |--------|--------|-------|-----------|
> | Discoverable skills | 8 | 1 | 87.5% |
> | Description chars | 3,267 | 330 | **90%** |
> | With overhead (~175/skill) | 4,667 | 505 | **89%** |
> 
> ### How It Works
> 
> 1. **Initial discovery**: Only `awareness:awareness` appears in available_skills
> 2. **Claude reads index**: Master skill lists all 8 sub-capabilities with when to use each
> 3. **Deep dive**: Claude uses Read tool to load full sub-skill content from `subskills/*.md`
> 4. **Supporting files**: Tools/hooks/queries remain accessible at original paths
> 
> ### To Test
> 
> **Restart Claude Code** to reload skills, then:
> ```
> User: "Help me learn about Claude Code hooks"
> Claude: Invokes awareness:awareness
> Claude: Sees "techniques" sub-skill covers hooks
> Claude: Reads subskills/techniques.md for detailed guidance
> ```
> 
> ### Next Steps
> 
> Apply this pattern to other plugins:
> - **agents** (18 skills → 1 master) - biggest impact
> - **knowledge-graphs** (17 skills → 1 master)  
> - **llms** (10 skills → 1 master)
> - **journal** (6 skills → 1 master)
> 
> Would you like me to apply this to another plugin?

> That's expected! The `claude-code-guide` subagent is hardcoded in the system prompt to handle questions about Claude Code features:
> 
> > "When the user directly asks about... how to use a specific Claude Code feature (eg. implement a hook)... Use the Task tool with subagent_type='claude-code-guide'"
> 
> The `awareness:awareness` skill serves a different purpose - meta-learning and creation, not direct feature questions.
> 
> ## Better Test Prompts
> 
> Try prompts that match the awareness skill's description but not claude-code-guide:
> 
> | Prompt | Should Match |
> |--------|--------------|
> | "Help me create a new skill for code review" | awareness → skill-creator |
> | "Build a knowledge graph from my conversation logs" | awareness → temporal-kg-memory |
> | "I want to systematically improve my Claude Code mastery" | awareness → techniques |
> | "Study how the logging plugin is implemented" | awareness → plugin-studier |
> 
> ## The Real Test
> 
> The real value is **character budget savings**. Before your restart:
> - Did you see `awareness:*` skills in the truncated list?
> - How many skills showed vs total? (was it "Showing X of Y"?)
> 
> After the change, you should see:
> - `awareness:awareness` instead of 8 separate awareness skills
> - More room for other plugins' skills to appear
> 
> Can you check:
> 1. What skills appear in your new session's available_skills?
> 2. Is the truncation less severe?

> I see the problem. We only converted **awareness** (8→1 skills), but the big offenders are still flat:
> 
> ## Current Character Budget Usage
> 
> | Plugin | Skills | Est. Chars | Status |
> |--------|--------|------------|--------|
> | agents | 18 | ~6,400 | **Flat - eating 43% of budget** |
> | llms | 10 | ~4,600 | **Flat - eating 31% of budget** |
> | schedule | 2 | ~500 | OK |
> | logging | 1 | ~300 | OK |
> | awareness | 1 | ~500 | **✓ Converted but truncated!** |
> | **Total shown** | ~31 | ~12,300 | 82% of 15k budget |
> 
> The awareness master skill **works** but gets truncated because agents+llms consume 74% of the budget before it's even considered.
> 
> ## What's Happening
> 
> ```
> Budget: 15,000 chars
>   └─ agents (18 skills):  6,400 chars  ← First in, big footprint
>   └─ llms (10 skills):    4,600 chars  ← Second in, big footprint  
>   └─ schedule (2):          500 chars  
>   └─ logging (1):           300 chars
>   └─ awareness (1):         500 chars  ← Gets TRUNCATED!
>                           ─────────
>   Total needed:          12,300+ chars
> ```
> 
> ## Solution: Apply Pattern to Big Plugins
> 
> Need to convert agents and llms to master skill pattern:
> 
> | Plugin | Before | After | Savings |
> |--------|--------|-------|---------|
> | agents | 18 skills, 6,400 chars | 1 master, ~500 chars | **~5,900 chars** |
> | llms | 10 skills, 4,600 chars | 1 master, ~500 chars | **~4,100 chars** |
> 
> **Total savings: ~10,000 chars** → All plugins would fit!
> 
> Want me to convert the **agents** plugin next? That's the biggest impact.
