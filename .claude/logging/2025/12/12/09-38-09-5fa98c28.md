> ## Agent Findings Summary
> 
> ### Agent 1: Code Review
> 
> **Task**: Review plugin files for quality and completeness
> 
> **Findings**:
> | Issue | Severity | Status |
> |-------|----------|--------|
> | Missing `.gitignore` | Minor | Fixed |
> | `package.json` missing scripts | Important | Fixed |
> | README had incorrect `bun install` instruction | Important | Fixed |
> | CLAUDE.md hardcodes status values | Moderate | Noted (acceptable with caveat) |
> | Skill `allowed-tools` very broad (11 tools) | Moderate | Acceptable for workflow skill |
> 
> **Verdict**: Well-structured plugin following marketplace patterns. Minor gaps addressed.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Agent 2: MCP Capabilities Research
> 
> **Task**: Deep dive into Backlog.md's full MCP feature set
> 
> **Findings** - Undocumented features discovered:
> 
> | Category | Features Found |
> |----------|----------------|
> | **AC Operations** | `acceptanceCriteriaCheck`, `acceptanceCriteriaUncheck`, `acceptanceCriteriaAdd`, `acceptanceCriteriaRemove`, `acceptanceCriteriaSet` |
> | **Plan/Notes** | `planSet`, `planAppend`, `planClear`, `notesSet`, `notesAppend`, `notesClear` |
> | **Workflow Tools** | `get_workflow_overview`, `get_task_creation_guide`, `get_task_execution_guide`, `get_task_completion_guide` |
> | **Advanced** | Sequences, cross-branch loading, drafts, status callbacks, ordinal reordering |
> 
> **Verdict**: Plugin documentation was incomplete. Added comprehensive Task Edit Operations section.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Agent 3: Pattern Comparison
> 
> **Task**: Compare backlog plugin against other marketplace plugins
> 
> **Findings**:
> 
> | Aspect | Comparison | Assessment |
> |--------|------------|------------|
> | **CLAUDE.md** | Exceeds Schedule.md in comprehensiveness | Excellent |
> | **plugin.json** | Complete with all recommended fields | Parity with best |
> | **Skills** | 1 skill (vs 2 in Schedule.md) | Could expand later |
> | **MCP config** | Lightweight delegation to backlog.md CLI | Appropriate |
> | **Commands** | 1 command (standard pattern) | Parity |
> 
> **Recommendations**:
> - Consider adding `task-search` skill for historical analysis
> - Consider adding `sprint-planning` skill for roadmapping
> - Add integration patterns with other plugins (Schedule, Journal, Logging)
> 
> **Verdict**: Production-ready, well-designed. Enhancement opportunities are optional.

> Are you currently using the backlog?

> No, I'm not currently using the backlog. Looking at my available tools, I don't see the backlog MCP tools (`task_create`, `task_list`, etc.) in my current session.
> 
> The plugin was just created, but:
> 
> 1. **MCP server not connected** - The backlog MCP server would need to be started/loaded for me to access its tools
> 2. **No backlog initialized** - Even if connected, we'd need to run `backlog init` in this project first
> 
> To use it, you would need to:
> 
> ```bash
> # In the plugin directory
> cd plugins/backlog
> npm install  # or let npx handle it
> 
> # Initialize backlog in this project (or any project)
> npx backlog.md init "Claude Marketplace"
> ```
> 
> Then restart Claude Code or reload the plugin so the MCP server connects.
> 
> Want me to initialize a backlog for this project? I could use the CLI fallback (`npx backlog.md`) since the MCP tools aren't available yet.
