`13:30:30` 🍄 User: Create institutional design plugin for companies
> /feature-dev:feature-dev Create a plugin called company this plugin should specialize in institutional design, it should understand all the different types of institutional vehicles one can create like companies, non profits, trusts, dunas, daos, all that stuff. It should be able to map to specific domains, the primary domain is Canadian jurisdiction, particularly in British Columbia, but the plugin will have international skillsets. The plugin must have a Canadian CPA / CFA expert subagent that is equipped with deep and broad skills that cover the entirety of those certifications. This subagent is also a tax consultant with the highest possible IQ and an incredible strategist mentor. Think Canadian Naval meets Elon Musk meets Dragons Den meets Vitalik Buterin meets CPA CFA and the equivalent of legal professions in Canada. This plugin will be my primary advisor for business legal and finance and personal legal and finance. This plugin will be my mentor. Please get oriented with the repository ecosystem and additionally get oriented with ../projects/ i've been writing some planning in there for that repository plugin marketplace as well where I will build out my specific companies as plugins and will have access to this advisor and this marketplace of plugins as well. Consult with the plugin dev. ultrathink with awareness.
