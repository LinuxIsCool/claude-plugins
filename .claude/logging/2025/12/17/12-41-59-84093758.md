> Based on recent activity, here are **5 likely work streams** you were engaged in:
> 
> ---
> 
> **1. Messages Plugin (Universal Messaging Backbone)**
> - Directory exists at `plugins/messages/` with `research/`, `specs/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/`, `src/`
> - Vision: Centralized local store for all messages across platforms (Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, emails, forum posts, HTTP requests, logs, transcripts)
> - Research phase: ATProtocol, Gnoster, Ethereum Attestations, ElizaOS database schema
> - Goal: Agent-to-agent communication + personal message aggregation
> 
> **2. Autocommit Plugin (Headless Claude VCS)**
> - Directory exists at `plugins/autocommit/` with hooks, commands, skills
> - Vision: Auto-commit on every agent Stop hook using headless Claude
> - Has a `/autocommit:status` command already wired up
> 
> **3. Official Plugins Exploration**
> - Journal entry from 09:41 today documents 10 official plugins
> - Curated to 8 after removing Greptile and Hookify
> - Left off with questions about how official plugins interact
> 
> **4. Projects Marketplace Interoperability**
> - Planning a second marketplace focused on project management
> - Considering how this marketplace's plugins can be used globally across projects there
> - Each project = a plugin in the new marketplace
> 
> **5. Master Search Plugin (Hybrid Rerank)**
> - Conceptual phase: fuzzy search, elastic search, keyword search, embeddings, graph RAG, ripgrep, LSP/AST
> - Not yet started in code

> 
> ---
> 
> **1. Autocommit Plugin Debugging** (Session `e3079ff0` - 12:42)
> - Hook IS running on `UserPromptSubmit`
> - Problem: Haiku keeps trying to "be helpful" instead of outputting `COMMIT` or `SKIP`
> - Haiku was trying to use tools: `"<function_calls><invok..."`
> - Stats: 5 SKIP (correct), 8 ERROR, 0 COMMIT
> - **Status: Prompt tuning issue identified**
> 
> **2. Autocommit `/organize` Command** (Session `835d7c4b` - 09:42)
> - Built `/autocommit:organize` slash command
> - Dry-run showed 88 uncommitted files across 8 namespaces
> - Discovered 48 auto-synced Google Calendar files (`gcal-*.md`)
> - Discussed whether to gitignore them
> - **Status: Testing the organize command**
> 
> **3. Logging Plugin Enhancement** (Session `e9f9a384` - 11:01)
> - Built `/logging:obsidian` command to open logs in Obsidian
> - Explored what PreToolUse/PostToolUse captures
> - Showed past 10 command inputs
> - **Status: Command completed**
> 
> **4. Data-as-Markdown Inventory** (Session `835d7c4b` - 12:30)
> - Spawned Archivist, Agent-Architect, Process-Cartographer
> - Mapped 14 data types in the repo
> - Created inventory at `.claude/archive/observations/2025-12-17-data-as-markdown-inventory.md`
> - Gap identified: No `data-steward` agent
> - **Status: Research complete**
> 
> **5. Official Plugins Exploration** (Session `835d7c4b` - 09:42)
> - Catalogued 10 official Claude plugins
> - Removed Greptile and Hookify (kept 8)

<summary>`13:18:19` 🌲 Claude: Obsidian URI cannot open graph view directly</summary>

> ## Investigation Results
> 
> ### Problem 1: Can't Auto-Open Graph View
> 
> **Obsidian's URI scheme doesn't support opening directly to graph view.** According to [Obsidian URI docs](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI), the `obsidian://open?path=...` scheme only opens the vault - it can't navigate to specific views.
> 
> Workarounds:
> - Press `Ctrl+G` after it opens
> - Use [Advanced Obsidian URI plugin](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/open-graph-view-in-new-window/42297) (untested)
> - Create a workspace with graph view and open that
> 
> ### Problem 2: Log Files Have No Wikilinks
> 
> Looking at your actual log file (`12-41-59-84093758.md`):
> 
> ```markdown
> # Session 84093758:0

> ```
> 
> **No `[[wikilinks]]` anywhere.** The graph would show 432 disconnected nodes - not useful.

> 
> ## What the Command Actually Does (Correctly)
> 
> ```bash
> xdg-open "obsidian://open?path=$LOGGING_DIR"
> ```
> 
> Opens the vault. That's all it can do with the basic URI scheme.
> 
> ## To Make It Useful
> 
> We'd need to:
> 
> 1. **Modify the logging hook** (`plugins/logging/hooks/log_event.py`) to inject wikilinks into generated markdown:
>    - `[[2025-12-17]]` date links
>    - Cross-session references
> 
> 2. **Consider a workspace file** - Pre-configure Obsidian to open graph view by default for this vault
>

> The command does **nothing with logging**. It's simpler than it looks:

> LOGGING_DIR="$(pwd)/.claude/logging"    # 1. Set a variable to the path
> 
> if [ -d "$LOGGING_DIR" ]; then          # 2. Check if directory exists

>     echo "success message"
> else
>     echo "directory not found"
> fi
> ```
> 
> That's it. Three things:
> 1. **Variable assignment** - store the path
> 2. **Directory check** - does `.claude/logging/` exist?
> 3. **xdg-open** - tell Linux to open the `obsidian://` URL scheme
> 
> The word "logging" in the command is just the **directory name** (`.claude/logging/`) - it's not doing any logging activity. The command doesn't track, record, or monitor anything.
> 
> The actual logging (recording your conversations) is done by the **logging plugin's hooks**, which run separately on every tool use and prompt. This command just opens that existing data in Obsidian.

> Excellent observation. Yes, that's exactly what's happening.

> 
> When `xdg-open` launches Obsidian, **Obsidian's debug output streams back** to the bash command:
> 
> ```
> Deleting cache directory: ...
> Debug: Will run Obsidian with the following arguments: 
> 2025-12-17 21:35:45 Loading main app package /app/resources/obsidian.asar
> 2025-12-17 21:35:45 Checking for update using Github
> ...
> ```
> 
> This is Obsidian's internal logging, not ours. And yes - **every line gets returned to me as part of the tool result**, consuming context unnecessarily.
> 
> ## The Fix
> 
> The current command has:
> ```bash
> xdg-open "obsidian://open?path=$LOGGING_DIR" 2>/dev/null
> ```
> 
> But that only suppresses stderr at the `xdg-open` level, not Obsidian's output. Should be:
> 
> ```bash
> xdg-open "obsidian://open?path=$LOGGING_DIR" >/dev/null 2>&1 &
> ```
> 
> - `>/dev/null` - discard stdout
> - `2>&1` - redirect stderr to stdout (also discarded)  
> - `&` - background it so bash returns immediately
>

> **Why this matters for context**: Every character returned from a tool call consumes context tokens. Obsidian was streaming ~500 bytes of debug logs per invocation. Over multiple uses, that adds up. The `&` backgrounding also means the command returns instantly instead of waiting for Obsidian to finish loading.

> Clean output - no more debug log streaming. The command returned instantly with just 3 lines.
> 
> Note: The slash command expanded with the **old version** from cache. The fix will take effect after clearing the plugin cache or restarting Claude Code. But I ran the fixed version directly to demonstrate it works.

<summary>`14:17:49` 🌲 Claude: Enable node labels in Obsidian graph view</summary>

> ## Node Labels in Obsidian Graph View
> 
> ### Turn On Labels
> 
> In the graph view, click the **gear icon** (settings) and look for:
> 
> - **Text fade threshold** - Controls when labels appear based on **zoom level**
>   - Lower value = labels appear when zoomed out more
>   - Higher value = need to zoom in closer to see labels
>   - Set to **0** to always show labels
> 
> ### Labels Only for Larger Nodes?
> 
> **Not natively supported.** There's a [feature request on the Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/graph-text-fade-threshold-consider-node-size/6737) asking for exactly this - "text fade threshold should consider node size, so larger nodes show labels when zoomed out, like a map." But it hasn't been implemented.
> 
> ### Workarounds
> 
> | Option | How |
> |--------|-----|
> | **Zoom + fade threshold** | Set text fade threshold low, zoom to show only the labels you want |
> | **Juggl plugin** | [Advanced graph plugin](https://github.com/HEmile/juggl) with full CSS control over styling |
> | **Filter by links** | In graph settings, filter to show only notes with N+ links |
> 
> ### Quick Settings Path
> 
> 1. Open graph (`Ctrl+G`)
> 2. Click gear icon (top-left of graph)
> 3. Expand **Display**
> 4. Adjust **Text fade threshold** slider

> Oh it turns on when I zoom in. Can you have it on at all zoom levels? And how can I toggle it on and off? 

<details>
<summary>`17:37:59` 🌲 Claude: Enable always-on graph labels at all zoom</summary>

> ## Always-On Labels
> 
> Set **Text fade threshold to 0** (or minimum):
> 
> 1. Open graph (`Ctrl+G`)
> 2. Click the **gear icon** (top-left)
> 3. Expand **Display**
> 4. Drag **Text fade threshold** slider all the way **left** to 0
> 
> This makes labels visible at all zoom levels.
> 
> ## Toggle On/Off
> 
> **No built-in toggle button.** Options:
> 
> | Method | How |
> |--------|-----|
> | **Slider** | Drag text fade threshold between 0 (always on) and 1 (fade with zoom) |
> | **Hotkey** | Not available natively for this setting |
> | **Style Settings plugin** | Some themes expose graph settings as toggles |
> 
> The quickest "toggle" is just dragging that slider - left for always-on, right for zoom-dependent.

> - Any real-time state of applications on your system

> Here are your graph settings:
> 
> | Setting | Value | Effect |

> | **Filter** | `path:.claude/journal/` | Only showing journal files |
> | **Text fade** | `0` | Labels always visible |
> | **Node size** | `0.48` | Slightly smaller nodes |
> | **Line thickness** | `0.47` | Thinner links |
> | **Repel strength** | `15.6` | High - nodes spread out |
> | **Center strength** | `0.53` | Medium centering |
> | **Show orphans** | `true` | Unlinked notes visible |
> | **Show arrows** | `false` | No directional arrows |
> 
> `★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
> **You filtered to journal only** (`path:.claude/journal/`), which is why you're seeing connections - the journal files have wikilinks! The logging files don't have wikilinks, so they'd appear as isolated nodes. Smart filtering.
> `─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
> 
> Note: You opened the **entire repo** as a vault, not just `.claude/logging/`. That's actually better since you can see journal, logging, and other markdown all in one graph.
