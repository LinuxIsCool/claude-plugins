> Which one is deprecated?

<details>
<summary>`08:45:14` 🌲 Claude</summary>

> The deprecated agent was **awareness:mentor** at the project level.
> 
> **What happened**: There were two identical `mentor` agents:
> 1. `.claude/agents/awareness:mentor.md` (project-level)
> 2. `plugins/awareness/agents/mentor.md` (plugin-level)
> 
> The project-level one was an exact duplicate that had been created during parallel session work. The plugin version is the authoritative one since mentor is part of the awareness plugin's persona.
> 
> **Resolution**: The duplicate was archived to `.claude/archive/agents/awareness-mentor-deprecated.md` with a deprecation header:
> 
> ```yaml
> ---
> name: mentor
> deprecated: 2025-12-15
> reason: Exact duplicate of plugins/awareness/agents/mentor.md
> replacement: awareness:mentor (plugin version)
> original-location: .claude/agents/awareness:mentor.md
> ---
> ```
> 
> The plugin version (`plugins/awareness/agents/mentor.md`) remains active and is the one synced to AgentNet as `awareness:mentor`.

> Good. The ecosystem is in a healthy state now—24 agents, all documented, governance framework in place, social layer active. 
> 
> Let me know if you want to explore anything else or if there's more work to tackle.
