> To make this graph rich, we'd need to either:

> Want me to expand the graph? I could start by ingesting the agent and persona definitions as nodes - that would add ~35 entities with clear relationships to each other.

> What's the cost of ingestion? ultrathink 

<details>
<summary>`09:09:41` 🌲 Claude</summary>

> This is a critical question. Let me break down the cost dimensions:
> 
> ## Cost Analysis by Approach
> 
> ### 1. Manual Extraction (current approach)
> 
> | Dimension | Cost |
> |-----------|------|
> | API tokens | $0 |
> | Compute | Negligible (FalkorDB writes) |
> | Human time | ~5-10 min/document |
> | **136 docs** | **11-23 hours of work** |
> 
> **Quality**: High precision, but doesn't scale.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 2. Structure-Only Parsing (no LLM)
> 
> Parse frontmatter, headers, wikilinks as nodes/edges.
> 
> | Dimension | Cost |
> |-----------|------|
> | API tokens | $0 |
> | Compute | ~1 minute total |
> | Human time | ~1 hour to write parser |
> 
> **Quality**: Gets structure but misses semantic meaning. A `[[link]]` becomes an edge, but we don't know *why* they're connected.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 3. LLM-based Extraction
> 
> Send documents to LLM, extract entities and relationships.
> 
> **Token estimation for 136 documents:**
> ```
> Average doc size: ~1,000 tokens
> Total input:      ~136,000 tokens
> Output per doc:   ~200 tokens (extracted concepts)
> Total output:     ~27,000 tokens
> ```
> 
> | Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | **Total** |
> |-------|------------|-------------|-----------|
> | Haiku | $0.03 | $0.03 | **~$0.07** |
> | Sonnet | $0.41 | $0.41 | **~$0.82** |
> | Opus | $2.04 | $2.04 | **~$4.00** |
> 
> **Quality**: Good extraction, may miss nuance or hallucinate relationships.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 4. Graphiti-style (Embeddings + LLM + Temporal)
> 
> Full knowledge graph with vector search, entity resolution, temporal edges.
> 
> | Component | Cost |
> |-----------|------|
> | Embeddings (OpenAI) | ~$0.02 (136K tokens) |
> | LLM extraction | ~$0.82 (Sonnet) |
> | Entity resolution | ~$0.20 (deduplication passes) |
> | **Total** | **~$1.00-1.50** |
> 
> **Quality**: Highest - semantic search, temporal awareness, entity deduplication.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## The Hidden Costs
> 
> ### Ongoing Maintenance
> ```
> New document created → needs ingestion
> Document edited     → needs re-ingestion  
> Document deleted    → needs graph cleanup
> ```
> 
> Without automation, the graph drifts from reality.
> 
> ### Quality Degradation
> - Automated extraction introduces noise
> - Noise accumulates over time
> - Eventually need human curation passes
> 
> ### Context Window Tax
> Every time we query the graph in a session, results consume context tokens. A dense graph with 500 nodes might return 50 relevant results = ~2,000 tokens of context per query.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## The Real Tradeoff
> 
> ```
>                     Quality
>                        ↑
>                        │
>          Graphiti ─────┼───── Manual
>          ($1.50)       │      (20 hrs)
>                        │
>     LLM Extraction ────┤
>          ($0.82)       │
>                        │
>    Structure-Only ─────┼─────
>          ($0)          │
>                        └──────────────→ Cost
> ```
> 
> **My recommendation**: Start with **LLM extraction using Haiku (~$0.07)** to populate a baseline graph, then selectively enrich high-value nodes manually. The 100x cost difference between Haiku and manual time makes automation compelling even if quality is 80% of manual.

> ---
> 
> ## Ownership Analysis
> 
> We're working with **two distinct knowledge graphs**:
> 
> | Graph | Purpose | Current State | Natural Owner |
> |-------|---------|---------------|---------------|
> | `claude_logs` | "What did we discuss?" | 468 nodes, 794 relationships | temporal-kg-memory skill |
> | `concepts` | "What do we know?" | 29 concepts, 63 relationships | **Unclear** |
> 
> The **concepts graph** work (what we did today) is fundamentally different from conversation log ingestion. It's about:
> - Extracting *named principles* from ecosystem documents
> - Tracking *provenance* (source, date, authoring agent)
> - Building a *semantic layer* of what we believe
> 
> ### Who Should Own This?
> 
> Reading the archivist definition, I see explicit alignment:
> 
> > "Coherence Maintenance: Ensure the system makes sense as a whole"
> > "Knowledge Graphs (when available) - Entity relationships, Temporal edges, Conceptual clusters"
> 
> The archivist authored "Semantic Coherence" as a concept. They track internal artifacts and maintain understanding. **The concepts graph is semantic coherence infrastructure.**
> 
> **Recommendation**: The **archivist** should own the concepts graph as part of their coherence maintenance responsibilities.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Skills Being Developed
> 
> Yes - we're developing practices that aren't yet codified. Today we exercised:
> 
> | Practice | What We Did | Skill Gap |
> |----------|-------------|-----------|
> | **Manual concept extraction** | Read docs, identified named concepts with definitions | No documented methodology |
> | **Provenance schema** | source file + introduced date + authoring agent | Not in temporal-kg-memory |
> | **Concept graph ingestion** | FalkorDB Cypher for Concept/Document nodes | Tools exist but not documented as skill |
> | **Semantic visualization** | D3.js force-directed with provenance tooltips | Ad-hoc, not templated |
> 
> ### Where Should This Live?
> 
> Two options:
> 
> 1. **Extend temporal-kg-memory** with a "Concept Layer" section
>    - Tools already live at `tools/concepts/`
>    - Keeps knowledge graph work together
>    - But it's philosophically different (documents vs logs)

> ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
> │  SEMANTIC LAYER (concepts graph)                        │
> │  "What do we know? What are our principles?"            │
> │  Owner: archivist (coherence maintenance)               │

> ## Immediate Next Steps
> 
> 1. **Document the practice** - Create `subskills/semantic-layer.md` under awareness
> 2. **Assign ownership** - Add concepts graph to archivist's domain
> 3. **Link the tools** - Reference `tools/concepts/` from the new sub-skill
> 4. **Update the skill index** - Add semantic-layer to the awareness master skill
> 
> Should I proceed with codifying this as a documented skill?
