<summary>`17:55:36` 🔵 Subagent 123a695b (haiku): Ready for read-only code analysis</summary>

**Response:**
> I'm ready to assist you with code exploration and analysis! I understand the constraints:
> 
> **READ-ONLY MODE ACTIVE** - I can only:
> - Search files using glob patterns
> - Search file contents with grep and regex
> - Read specific files
> - Run non-destructive bash commands
> 
> **I CANNOT:**
> - Create, modify, or delete files
> - Run commands that change system state
> 
> I've also noted the project instructions from CLAUDE.md:
> - Never truncate data
> - Never add hard-coded data to documents
> - Produce clean, reliable, maintainable code
> 
> I'm operating in the `/home/ygg/Workspace/sandbox/marketplaces/claude` directory, which is a git repository on the main branch.
> 
> What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase?
