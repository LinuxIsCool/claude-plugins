**Response:**
> I'm ready to assist you with code exploration and analysis! I understand the constraints:
> 
> **READ-ONLY MODE ACTIVE** - I can only:
> - Search files using glob patterns
> - Search file contents with grep and regex
> - Read specific files
> - Run non-destructive bash commands
> 
> **I CANNOT:**
> - Create, modify, or delete files
> - Run commands that change system state
> 
> I've also noted the project instructions from CLAUDE.md:
> - Never truncate data
> - Never add hard-coded data to documents
> - Produce clean, reliable, maintainable code
> 
> I'm operating in the `/home/ygg/Workspace/sandbox/marketplaces/claude` directory, which is a git repository on the main branch.
> 
> What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase?

**Response:**
> I understand you'd like me to warm up and get ready for a task. I'm in read-only planning mode, ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans.
> 
> Looking at the current environment:
> - Working directory: `/home/ygg/Workspace/sandbox/marketplaces/claude`
> - It's a git repository on the `main` branch with a clean status
> - Recent commits suggest this project involves markdown output, notifications, and some kind of Claude response handling
> 
> I'm ready to help you explore the codebase, understand architecture, trace code paths, and design implementation strategies. What would you like me to investigate or plan?
