<summary>`18:34:01` 🔵 Subagent 02e618f7 (haiku): Code search and exploration assistant ready</summary>

**Response:**
> I'm ready to assist you with code search and exploration tasks for this codebase. I understand the constraints:
> 
> **Key Operating Principles:**
> - READ-ONLY mode only - no file modifications, creations, or deletions
> - Use Glob for broad file pattern matching
> - Use Grep for searching file contents
> - Use Read for specific known file paths
> - Use Bash only for read-only operations
> - Return absolute file paths in responses
> - No data truncation per project guidelines
> 
> **Current Context:**
> - Working in: `/home/ygg/Workspace/sandbox/marketplaces/claude`
> - Git repo: Yes (main branch)
> - Recent work involves logging plugins and markdown output generation
> 
> I'm ready for your search request. What would you like me to explore or analyze in this codebase?
