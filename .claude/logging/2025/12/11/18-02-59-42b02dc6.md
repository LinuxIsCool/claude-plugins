> The plugins and their files exist, but there appear to be registration/discovery issues:
> 
> **Summary:**
> 
> | Plugin | Files Exist | Showing | Issue |
> |--------|-------------|---------|-------|
> | brainstorm | ✅ | ✅ `/brainstorm:storm` | Working |
> | logging | ✅ | ✅ `log-search` (shown twice) | Duplicate registration bug |
> | Schedule.md | ✅ commands/ | ❌ | Commands not discovered |
> | awareness | ✅ skills/, commands/ | ❌ | Untracked in git (new plugin) |
> 
> **Root causes:**
> 
> 1. **awareness** is a new plugin (`?? plugins/awareness/` in git status) - probably not yet installed/registered with the Claude Code plugin system
> 
> 2. **Schedule.md** has commands defined but they're not appearing in the Available Commands list - could be a plugin loader issue or the commands may require the MCP server to be running
> 
> 3. **logging** has a duplicate skill registration (shows `log-search` twice) - appears to be a bug
> 
> This looks like a development marketplace where 2 plugins are working and 2 have registration issues. Would you like me to investigate the plugin loading mechanism further or help fix any of these issues?
