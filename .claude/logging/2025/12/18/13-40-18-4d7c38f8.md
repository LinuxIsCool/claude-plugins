<summary>`13:44:10` 🌲 Claude: Disable web dashboard auto-launch setting</summary>

> Found it. Line 35-36 is your culprit:
> 
> ```yaml
> web_dashboard_open_on_launch: true
> ```
> 
> **Serena** is a semantic code analysis MCP server that gives Claude Code advanced capabilities for understanding code structure, finding symbols, and making precise edits. The web dashboard shows logs of what Serena is doing.
> 
> To stop the browser from opening, edit `~/.serena/serena_config.yml` and change line 35:
> 
> ```yaml
> web_dashboard_open_on_launch: false
> ```
> 
> You can also disable the web dashboard entirely if you don't need it by setting `web_dashboard: false` on line 27.
> 
> `★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
> Serena provides the `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__*` tools you see in this environment - things like `find_symbol`, `replace_symbol_body`, etc. These are more precise than text-based search/replace because they understand the actual code structure via Language Server Protocol (LSP). The dashboard is mainly for debugging if something goes wrong.
