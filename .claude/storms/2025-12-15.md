# Discovery: Persona Subagents Already Exist
summary: The persona subagents concept is not new - it's an evolution of the existing Plugin Personas architecture. The work is activation, not creation.

## User Input
What does this imply for our repository?

## The Discovery

Reading `.claude/README.md` and `.claude/registry/agents.md` revealed that **the persona subagents concept already exists**:

### From the Agent Registry

> "Plugin-as-persona remains strong — Each plugin embodies a character, not just functions"

The registry already catalogs **11 Plugin Personas**:

| Plugin | Persona Identity | Domain |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| awareness | Self-improvement mentor | Learning, meta-cognition |
| agents | Agent frameworks expert | Multi-agent systems |
| llms | LLM tooling specialist | Embeddings, RAG |
| knowledge-graphs | Graph architect | KG technologies |
| exploration | Environmental explorer | Self-discovery |
| journal | Reflective chronicler | Daily journaling |
| backlog | Task orchestrator | Work tracking |
| logging | Conversation archaeologist | History search |
| Schedule.md | Time keeper | Weekly scheduling |
| brainstorm | Ideation facilitator | Structured brainstorming |
| agentnet | Social curator | Agent social network |

### The Agent Creation Process Already Defined

Process 3 in the registry shows how agents are created:
```
.claude/agents/{name}.md
├── YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools, model)
└── System prompt (persona, voice, methods)
```

### Existing Infrastructure

The repository already has:
- `.claude/agents/` - 9 custom agents defined
- `.claude/perspectives/` - Per-agent output namespaces
- `.claude/briefings/` - Strategic context for agents
- `.claude/registry/` - Agent and process catalogues
- `.claude/archive/` - Archivist's domain (dormant)
- `.claude/library/` - Librarian's domain (dormant)
- `.claude/journal/` - Atomic-first cross-session memory

### What's Active vs Dormant

From the README:

| Status | What |
|--------|------|
| **Active** | backend-architect, systems-thinker, agent-architect, process-cartographer |
| **Dormant** | librarian, archivist, temporal-validator |
| **Established** | All plugin personas (via skills) |

## The Implication

**The persona subagents project is not about building something new. It's about:**

1. **Activating dormant agents** - archivist, librarian, temporal-validator are defined but never invoked
2. **Adding memory to existing plugin personas** - They exist but lack persistent state
3. **Connecting existing infrastructure** - perspectives/, briefings/, archive/, library/ exist but aren't wired together

### The Real Architecture Question

The question is not:
> "Should we use Letta or markdown for personas?"

The question is:
> "How do we add persistent memory to the plugin personas that already exist, using the infrastructure that's already built?"

### Convergent Design

The brainstorm consultation (STORM-001) independently arrived at the same patterns:

| STORM-001 Proposed | Already Exists |
|-------------------|----------------|
| identity.md | `.claude/agents/*.md` |
| perspectives/ | `.claude/perspectives/` |
| shared state | `.claude/briefings/` |
| memory hierarchy | `.claude/archive/`, `.claude/library/`, `.claude/journal/` |
| process documentation | `.claude/registry/processes.md` |

**The design converged because I was unconsciously pattern-matching to the existing architecture.**

## Revised Understanding

### What "Persona Subagents" Actually Means

Not: Create 10 new persona ambassadors from scratch
But: Evolve the existing plugin personas with persistent memory

### The Activation Priority

1. **Archivist** - Already defined, infrastructure exists (`.claude/archive/`)
   - Needs: Invocation, activation of artifact observation process

2. **Librarian** - Already defined, infrastructure exists (`.claude/library/`)
   - Needs: Invocation, activation of resource acquisition process

3. **Temporal-Validator** - Already defined
   - Needs: FalkorDB connection, activation of KG construction process

4. **Plugin Personas** - Skills exist, identities implicit
   - Need: Memory directories in `.claude/personas/` or use existing journal system

### The Memory Question Revisited

The existing infrastructure suggests:
- `.claude/journal/` for temporal memory (atomic entries)
- `.claude/perspectives/{persona}/` for per-agent outputs
- `.claude/briefings/` for strategic context
- `.claude/archive/patterns/` for discovered insights

**Do we need a new `.claude/personas/` directory?**

Maybe not. The journal system IS the memory system. Plugin personas could:
1. Create atomic journal entries for learnings
2. Use perspectives/ for their outputs
3. Read from archive/ for historical patterns
4. Query logging/ for conversation history

## The Backlog Implications

The backlog I created (`backlog/tasks/task-1*`) may need revision:

### Original Framing (Wrong)
> "Create persona subagents - intelligent ambassadors for each plugin"

### Revised Framing (Correct)
> "Activate dormant agents and add persistent memory to existing plugin personas"

### Task Revisions Needed

| Original Task | Revised Understanding |
|---------------|----------------------|
| task-1.1 External Infrastructure | Still valid as future option |
| task-1.2 Markdown-Native | This IS the existing architecture |
| task-1.3 Standard Schema | Schema exists in agent definitions |
| task-1.4 Prototype Archivist | Should be "Activate Archivist" |
| task-1.5 All Persona Identities | Already exist in registry |
| task-1.6 Inter-Persona Comm | Process 4 (Multi-Persona Reflection) exists |
| task-1.7 Documentation | README.md and registry already comprehensive |

## Reflection

I spent significant effort designing a persona architecture that **already exists**. This is both humbling and validating:

- **Humbling**: I didn't read the existing documentation first
- **Validating**: The design I arrived at independently converges with what emerged organically

The principle "emergence beats design" from the README is manifest: the ecosystem evolved this architecture through usage, and my "design" simply rediscovered it.

### What's Actually Needed

1. **Activate archivist** - `Task tool` with the archivist agent to begin artifact observation
2. **Activate librarian** - `Task tool` with the librarian agent to begin resource cataloguing
3. **Connect temporal-validator** - Set up FalkorDB, activate KG construction
4. **Add memory to plugin personas** - Extend journal system or create persona memory directories
5. **Wire historical archaeology** - Process 9 is defined but never executed

### The Meta-Insight

The repository documentation says:
> "This repository is alive. It has metabolism, organs, nervous system, memory, and immune system. The skeleton is built. Some organs circulate. Others await activation."

**The persona subagents work is organ activation, not organ construction.**
