The governance framework creates observability for what was already happening implicitly.

Before: Agents emerged through parallel sessions, coordinating via git without knowing it.
After: We can see the patterns, measure health, apply selection pressure.

Key feedback loop established:
Growth → Health Review → Governance Decision → Adjusted Growth

This is Ashby's Law in action: variety in the regulator (governance) must match variety in the system (agent ecosystem). The 24-agent inventory is the requisite variety map.

The question now: what balancing loops prevent runaway growth? The deprecation triggers are the answer.
