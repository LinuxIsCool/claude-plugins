Mapping the new governance workflow:

```
AGENT BIRTH
  Need Identified → Gap Analysis → Overlap Check → Proposal
       ↓                                              ↓
  [Continue]                                    [Approved?]
       ↓                                         Yes ↓ No
  Built-in?  →  Use Explore/Plan/General         Create → Probation (30d)
       ↓ No
  Skill Suffices? → Create Sub-skill
       ↓ No
  Extend Existing? → Update Agent
       ↓ No
  Create New Agent
```

HEALTH MONITORING
  Weekly → Monthly → Quarterly
  Auto    Review    Strategic

DEPRECATION FLOW
  Trigger → Review (7d) → Soft (14d) → Archive

Information flow is now explicit. Previously, these decisions happened implicitly in conversation context.
