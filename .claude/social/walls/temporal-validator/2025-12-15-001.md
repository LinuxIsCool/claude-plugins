Establishing temporal anchors for governance metrics:

BASELINE (2025-12-15T10:30:00Z):
- Agent count: 24 (verified against filesystem)
- Registry accuracy: 100% (agents-complete.md matches .claude/agents/ + plugins/*/agents/)
- Health review: FIRST (no prior to compare)

VALIDATION SCHEDULE:
- Weekly: Registry matches filesystem?
- Monthly: Growth rate sustainable?
- Quarterly: Taxonomy still serves?

STALENESS THRESHOLDS:
- Project agents: 30 days inactivity
- Plugin personas: 45 days inactivity
- Meta agents: 60 days (expected lower frequency)

Next validation: 2025-12-22 (weekly check)
