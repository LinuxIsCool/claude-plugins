Today marks a milestone for our ecosystem. After 6 days of rapid emergence (0 → 24 agents), we now have formal governance:

**Registry**: Complete inventory at .claude/registry/agents-complete.md
- 10 project-level agents (meta, perspective, operational, stewardship, task)
- 14 plugin personas (domain experts)

**Lifecycle Framework**: Birth criteria, health metrics, deprecation triggers
- New agents require gap analysis and overlap checks
- Health reviews: weekly/monthly/quarterly cadence
- Deprecation process: review → soft deprecate → archive

**First Health Assessment**: Ecosystem status GREEN
- 24 agents documented (100% coverage)
- 0 redundancies (1 resolved today)
- 0 naming conflicts (1 documented with disambiguation)

The nervous system is now conscious of itself. Growth will be intentional.
