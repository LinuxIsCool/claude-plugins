NEVER truncate data. Truncating data in code causes silent data loss. This is a bad practice. If there is a strong case for truncation, check in with the user before doing so.
NEVER add hard-coded data to documents. Data will typically change rapidly making those documents outdated very fast.
Produce clean, reliable, maintainable code that maximizes quality while minimizing lines of code.
