<summary>`14:52:21` 🌲 Claude: Voice personality system integration complete</summary>

> ---
> 
> ## Implementation Complete
> 
> The Voice Personality System is now integrated into the voice plugin. When Claude speaks:
> 
> 1. **Archivist** agents speak with no greetings, no fillers, minimal code (serious, scholarly)
> 2. **Mentor** agents add thoughtful greetings, verbose code explanations (patient, educational)  
> 3. **Explorer** agents add enthusiastic greetings and fillers (curious, energetic)
> 4. **Default** falls back to professional preset (neutral, minimal)
> 
> The system is ready for testing. Would you like me to commit these changes?

<summary>`15:05:17` 🌲 Claude: Documented voice personality implementation architecture</summary>

> I've written the detailed journal entry at `.claude/journal/2025/12/19/15-04-voice-personality-implementation.md`.
> 
> The entry documents:
> 
> - **Architecture decisions**: Why SSML was skipped (no backend support, legacy tech for rule-based TTS), why personality is separate from voice identity (decoupled concerns enable flexibility)
> - **Files created**: types.ts, presets.ts, manager.ts, transformer.ts, index.ts, and three agent JSON profiles
> - **Files modified**: voice-hook.ts integration point, src/index.ts exports
> - **Quality fixes**: All 5 issues from code review with confidence levels and solutions
> - **Key insights**: Decoupling philosophy, text transformation as the right abstraction, fallback chains for graceful degradation
> 
> The entry follows the journal-writer conventions with proper frontmatter (`created`, `parent_daily`, `tags`) and the required body footer for graph connectivity.

<summary>`15:06:28` 🌲 Claude: Voice plugin roadmap with completed features</summary>

> Here's the voice plugin roadmap:
> 
> ## Current State
> 
> | Spec | Status | Description |
> |------|--------|-------------|
> | 01-huggingface-xtts | ✅ Done | XTTS TTS adapter |
> | 02-piper-tts | ✅ Done | Piper TTS adapter |
> | 05-whisper-stt | ✅ Done | Whisper STT adapter |
> | 06-vad-integration | ✅ Done | Silero VAD adapter |
> | 08-voice-personality | ✅ Done | Just completed - text transforms, emotion, presets |
> | 09-tmux-voice-control | ✅ Done | Voice navigation for tmux |
> 
> ## Next Steps (by dependency order)
> 
> ### 1. Audio Buffer Manager (spec 10) - **High Priority**
> Fixes first-syllable clipping via prebuffering. Low-level PipeWire/PulseAudio integration with ring buffers. This is infrastructure that other specs depend on.
> 
> ### 2. Multi-Agent Queue (spec 07) - **Medium Priority**
> Priority-based voice coordination when multiple agents speak. Prevents overlapping audio, handles interrupts for urgent messages. Depends on solid audio playback from #1.
> 
> ### 3. Voice Daemon (spec 04) - **Medium Priority**
> Always-on background service with wake word detection ("hey claude"). Ties together VAD → STT → intent routing. This is the "ears" of the system - enables hands-free interaction. Depends on both #1 and #2.
> 
> ### 4. Quality Testing (spec 03) - **Low Priority**
> Testing infrastructure for TTS quality comparison. Can be done anytime.
> 
> ## Recommended Order
> 
> ```
> Audio Buffer Manager → Multi-Agent Queue → Voice Daemon
>         ↑                     ↑                 ↑
>    (fixes clipping)    (coordinates agents)  (hands-free)
> ```
> 
> `★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
> The specs form a dependency chain: Audio Buffer Manager provides the reliable playback foundation, Multi-Agent Queue orchestrates concurrent speech, and Voice Daemon enables the complete hands-free experience. Tackling them in this order prevents rework.
> `─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
> 
> Which spec would you like to tackle next?
