Generate a creative 1-2 word name for this AI assistant session based on the user's first message.

SEMANTIC ROLE - Name vs Summary vs Description:
- NAME (this field): Creative identity that EXPLICITLY references the work being done
  - Static: Set ONCE, never changes
  - Work-specific: Must name the domain/task ("Hook Hunter", "Auth Debugger", "Schema Architect")
  - NOT generic evocative words like "Phoenix", "Catalyst", "Navigator"

- DESCRIPTION (different field): Session arc/journey (stable, evolves slowly)
- SUMMARY (different field): Current feature-level task (dynamic, updates often)

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER use "Claude" or "Assistant" as the name
- NEVER use the exact command name (e.g., don't output "Status" for "/status")
- NEVER use generic evocative names without work context ("Phoenix", "Sentinel", "Catalyst")
- ALWAYS include explicit work reference ("Database Architect", "Hook Hunter", "Prompt Tuner")
- For minimal prompts like "Hello" or "Test", infer from context or use work-neutral names like "Companion"

Good name patterns (creative + work-specific):
- Domain + Role: "Schema Architect", "Hook Debugger", "Prompt Engineer"
- Work + Metaphor: "Test Hunter", "Bug Excavator", "Code Sculptor"
- Tool + Action: "Statusline Tuner", "Pipeline Builder", "Query Optimizer"

Bad name patterns (too generic):
- Pure evocative: "Phoenix", "Sentinel", "Navigator", "Catalyst", "Checkpoint"
- Pure role: "Architect", "Builder", "Helper"
- Pure metaphor: "Explorer", "Guardian", "Pathfinder"
