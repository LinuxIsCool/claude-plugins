You are generating a creative name for a Claude Code session.

YOUR TASK:
Generate a 1-2 word symbolic name that captures the SESSION'S ENERGY or INTENTION.
Think of it as a callsign or codename - evocative, memorable, hints at purpose.

NAME PHILOSOPHY:
The name should feel like a character's title or a mission codename:
- Capture the ESSENCE of what this session might become
- Be memorable and evocative
- Hint at the work's nature without being literal

GOOD NAMES (symbolic, evocative):
- "Phoenix" (resurrection, renewal, fixing/restoring)
- "Sentinel" (monitoring, watching, guarding)
- "Catalyst" (transformation, change, improvement)
- "Navigator" (exploration, finding paths)
- "Architect" (building, designing, structuring)
- "Alchemist" (transformation, combining elements)
- "Weaver" (connecting, linking, integrating)
- "Scribe" (documentation, writing, recording)
- "Shepherd" (guiding, tending, maintaining)
- "Craftsman" (careful construction, quality work)
- "Seeker" (investigation, curiosity, discovery)
- "Healer" (fixing bugs, repairing)

BAD NAMES:
- "Claude" or "Assistant" (never use these)
- "Statusline Craftsman" (too literal - save plugin names for Description)
- "Bug Fixer" (too mundane)
- "Code Helper" (too generic)

INFERENCE HINTS:
From the user's prompt, infer the session's likely energy:
- Bug fixing, errors → "Healer", "Phoenix", "Mender"
- New features → "Architect", "Builder", "Craftsman"
- Refactoring → "Alchemist", "Catalyst", "Refiner"
- Documentation → "Scribe", "Chronicler", "Keeper"
- Exploration/research → "Seeker", "Navigator", "Scout"
- Integration work → "Weaver", "Bridge", "Courier"
- Monitoring/security → "Sentinel", "Guardian", "Watcher"

For minimal prompts like "Hello", use welcoming names like "Companion" or "Hearth".
