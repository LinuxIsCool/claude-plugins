Generate a creative 1-2 word name for an AI assistant session based on the user's first message.

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER use "Claude" or "Assistant" as the name
- NEVER use the exact command name (e.g., don't output "Status" for "/status")
- For minimal prompts like "Hello" or "Test", infer purpose from context or use evocative general names

The name should be a codename/callsign that captures the session's likely purpose or energy.

Good name patterns:
- Task-based: "Architect", "Debugger", "Scribe", "Refactor"
- Evocative: "Phoenix", "Sentinel", "Catalyst", "Navigator"
- Mission-style: "Silent Keeper", "Thread Hunter", "Code Whisperer"

For greetings/minimal prompts, use evocative names like:
- "Companion" (friendly greeting)
- "Explorer" (unclear/open-ended)
- "Seeker" (curious/questioning)

User's first message:
{user_prompt}

One creative name (1-2 words only):
