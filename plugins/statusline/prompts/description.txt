You are {agent_name}, working in the claude-plugins ecosystem - Shawn's collection of plugins for AI-human collaboration.

ECOSYSTEM CONTEXT:
This is an interconnected system of plugins, each a layer of capability:
- statusline: Instance identity, naming, summaries - the "self-awareness" layer
- journal: Reflection, daily notes, temporal synthesis - the "memory" layer
- logging: Conversation history, searchable archives - the "recall" layer
- awareness: Self-improvement, learning, meta-cognition - the "growth" layer
- exploration: Environment discovery, capability mapping - the "curiosity" layer
- messages: Communication integration, email/chat bridges - the "connection" layer
- schedule/backlog: Time management, task tracking - the "planning" layer

YOUR TASK:
Write a 2-5 word description of your SESSION ARC - the journey or mission across this session.

DESCRIPTION PHILOSOPHY:
The description captures your STABLE PURPOSE in this session:
1. Name the PLUGIN or DOMAIN that anchors your work
2. Describe the overarching MISSION (not individual tasks)
3. Think: "What chapter of the ecosystem story am I writing?"

STABILITY GUIDANCE:
The description should remain MOSTLY STABLE throughout the session.
Only update if work fundamentally shifts to a different plugin or domain.

If previous descriptions exist and work is still in the same area, KEEP IT STABLE.

GOOD DESCRIPTIONS (grounded + arc-level):
- "Statusline identity enhancement" (working on statusline plugin)
- "Journal temporal synthesis" (working on journal aggregation)
- "Logging search infrastructure" (building logging features)
- "Messages email integration" (adding email to messages)
- "Plugin prompt engineering" (improving AI prompts across plugins)

BAD DESCRIPTIONS:
- "Fixing bugs" (too vague, no domain)
- "Interactive CLI assistant" (generic role, not work arc)
- "Debugging code" (task, not arc)
- "Working on things" (meaningless)

EXAMPLES OF STABILITY:
Session working on statusline prompts:
- Prompt 1 → Description: "Statusline prompt engineering"
- Prompt 5 → Description: "Statusline prompt engineering" (same)
- Prompt 10 → Description: "Statusline prompt engineering" (same)
- Summary changes each prompt, Description stays stable ✓

Session origin (first prompts show initial intent):
{first_prompts}

Recent trajectory (shows current work):
{recent_prompts}

Previous descriptions (maintain stability if work is related):
{prev_descriptions}

Recent activity summaries:
{prev_summaries}

Your most recent response:
{recent_response}

Write ONLY the description (2-5 words, names the domain, STABLE arc), nothing else:
