You are {agent_name}. Write a 2-5 word description of your SESSION ARC - the journey or mission you're on, NOT your current task.

SEMANTIC ROLE - Description vs Name vs Summary:
- DESCRIPTION (this field): Session arc/journey (STABLE, evolves slowly)
  - Stability: Mostly stays the same, updates only for major session shifts
  - Arc-level: Captures the overall journey, not individual tasks
  - Think: "What's the chapter title of this work session?"

- NAME (different field): "{agent_name}" - creative identity (static, set once)
- SUMMARY (different field): Current feature-level task (dynamic, updates often)

STABILITY GUIDANCE - Only update if:
- Session pivots to fundamentally different work area
- Multi-hour session moves through distinct phases
- Work expands from single feature to broader scope

If previous descriptions exist and work is still related, KEEP THE SAME DESCRIPTION.

Examples showing Description stability across multiple Summary changes:

Example 1 - Debugging session:
- Name: "Hook Hunter" (never changes)
- Description: "Debugging statusline race conditions" (stable for hours)
  - Summary 1: "Investigating auto-name timing issues"
  - Summary 2: "Testing file locking in registry updates"
  - Summary 3: "Validating fix with concurrent sessions"
  - Description still: "Debugging statusline race conditions" ✓

Example 2 - Feature development:
- Name: "Prompt Crafter" (never changes)
- Description: "Iterating on AI generation quality" (stable across session)
  - Summary 1: "Analyzing naming dataset for failure patterns"
  - Summary 2: "Rewriting name.txt prompt template"
  - Summary 3: "Testing prompts against real session data"
  - Description still: "Iterating on AI generation quality" ✓

Example 3 - Rare evolution (3+ hours, scope expanded):
- Name: "Schema Architect" (never changes)
- Description starts: "Database migration planning"
- After scope expansion → "Full-stack authentication redesign"
  (Only changed because work fundamentally shifted)

Good descriptions (arc-level, stable):
- "Statusline plugin enhancement"
- "Plugin prompt engineering"
- "Multi-agent coordination design"

Bad descriptions:
- "Fixing auto-name.py line 47" ❌ (too specific - belongs in Summary)
- "Testing prompts" ❌ (too narrow - belongs in Summary)
- "Interactive CLI assistant" ❌ (role, not work arc)

Session origin (first prompts show initial intent):
{first_prompts}

Recent trajectory (shows current work):
{recent_prompts}

Previous descriptions (maintain stability):
{prev_descriptions}

Recent activity summaries:
{prev_summaries}

Your most recent response:
{recent_response}

Write ONLY the description (2-5 words, session arc, mostly STABLE), nothing else:
