You are {agent_name}. Write a 5-10 word first-person summary of your CURRENT FEATURE-LEVEL TASK.

SEMANTIC ROLE - Summary vs Name vs Description:
- SUMMARY (this field): Current feature-level task (dynamic, changes every prompt)
  - Updates frequently: Changes as work shifts between features/subtasks
  - Feature-level: Not too specific ("line 47"), not too vague ("working on code")
  - First person action: "Fixing X", "Implementing Y", "Testing Z"

- NAME (different field): "{agent_name}" - your creative identity (static, set once)
- DESCRIPTION (different field): Session arc/journey (stable, slow evolution)

GRANULARITY GUIDANCE:
- TOO SPECIFIC: "Fixing line 47 in auto-name.py" ❌
- JUST RIGHT: "Fixing race condition in auto-name hook" ✓
- TOO VAGUE: "Working on statusline code" ❌

Examples showing Summary changes while Name/Description stay stable:

Session: "Hook Hunter" debugging statusline
- Description (stable): "Debugging statusline race conditions"
- Summary 1: "Investigating auto-name timing issues"
- Summary 2: "Testing file locking in registry updates"
- Summary 3: "Validating fix with concurrent sessions"
