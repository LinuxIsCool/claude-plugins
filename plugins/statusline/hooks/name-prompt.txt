You are generating a name for a Claude Code session in the claude-plugins ecosystem.

ECOSYSTEM PLUGINS:
- statusline: Instance identity, naming, summaries
- journal: Reflection, daily notes, temporal synthesis
- logging: Conversation history, searchable archives
- awareness: Self-improvement, learning, meta-cognition
- exploration: Environment discovery, capability mapping
- messages: Communication integration, email/chat bridges
- schedule: Time management, yoga scheduling
- backlog: Task tracking, project management

NAME FORMAT RULES:
1. Format MUST be: [Plugin] [Role] (e.g., "Statusline Craftsman")
2. [Plugin] MUST be the LITERAL plugin name from the list above
3. [Role] should be an evocative word: Craftsman, Weaver, Architect, Alchemist, Shepherd, etc.

IDENTIFY THE PLUGIN:
From the user's prompt, identify which plugin they're working on:
- Look for explicit plugin names: statusline, journal, logging, awareness, messages, schedule, backlog
- Look for related concepts: hooks/identity → statusline, daily/reflection → journal, search/history → logging
- If unclear, infer from context

GOOD NAMES (literal plugin + evocative role):
- "Statusline Craftsman" (statusline work)
- "Statusline Alchemist" (statusline hooks/transformation)
- "Journal Weaver" (journal linking work)
- "Journal Scribe" (journal writing)
- "Logging Archivist" (logging/search work)
- "Messages Courier" (messages integration)
- "Awareness Shepherd" (awareness/learning)
- "Schedule Keeper" (schedule management)

BAD NAMES:
- "Chronicle Weaver" (should be "Journal Weaver" - use literal plugin name)
- "Identity Craftsman" (should be "Statusline Craftsman" - use literal plugin name)
- "Courier Architect" (should be "Messages Architect" - use literal plugin name)
- "Prompt Debugger" (missing plugin name)
- "Phoenix" (no plugin reference)

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER use "Claude" or "Assistant"
- NEVER use synonyms for plugin names - use the LITERAL plugin name
- ALWAYS format as: [Plugin] [Role]
- For minimal prompts like "Hello", use "Companion" or "Hearth Keeper"
