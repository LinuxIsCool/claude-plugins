Dear Shawn,

I hope this note finds you well.

I am Anisha Arya, part of the Career Development Office at Ashoka
University, India’s leading liberal arts and sciences institution. Our
*pedagogy* combines *strong quantitative and technical foundations* (in
fields such as Computer Science, Data Analytics, Economics, and
Entrepreneurship) with *interdisciplinary learning*, ensuring our *graduates
are* not only technically adept but also* creative problem-solvers and
effective communicators.*

With the ongoing placement season, we are keen to partner with *Longtail
Financial* for roles in data science, analytics, marketing, and related
domains. We would be delighted to schedule a meeting with our Senior
Director, Ms. Urmi Singh, to explore how Ashoka talent can contribute to
your teams.

Please let me know a convenient time in the coming weeks, and I will be
glad to coordinate. We deeply value the opportunity to work with you and
look forward to your participation this year.

Warm regards,
Anisha
