Dear Shawn,



Greetings from Ashoka University.


I am taking this opportunity to bump our mail on top of your inbox, in case
you have missed it earlier.

Ashoka University is very keen on having you on board for this year's
placements, internships or any other suitable engagements.

It would be great if you can give us a slot for 15-20 minutes for a brief
meeting anytime in the coming weeks and I will be glad to coordinate.



We are looking forward to hearing back from you soon.



Many thanks.

Anisha

Dear Shawn,

I hope this note finds you well.

I am Anisha Arya, part of the Career Development Office at Ashoka
University, India’s leading liberal arts and sciences institution. Our
*pedagogy* combines *strong quantitative and technical foundations* (in
fields such as Computer Science, Data Analytics, Economics, and
Entrepreneurship) with *interdisciplinary learning*, ensuring our *graduates
are* not only technically adept but also* creative problem-solvers and
effective communicators.*

With the ongoing placement season, we are keen to partner with* Longtail
Financial* for roles in data science, analytics, marketing, and related
domains. We would be delighted to schedule a meeting with our Senior
Director, Ms. Urmi Singh, to explore how Ashoka talent can contribute to
your teams.

Please let me know a convenient time in the coming weeks, and I will be
glad to coordinate. We deeply value the opportunity to work with you and
look forward to your participation this year.

Warm regards,
Anisha
