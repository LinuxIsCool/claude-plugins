Dear Shawn,

**Most founders only hear the M&A stories that make headlines.**

Almost no one talks about the moments that actually decide the deal.

The late-night calls.
The missteps that almost killed it.
The buyer hesitation no one saw coming.
The silence that suddenly felt too long.

At TechExit.io Vancouver 2026 https://techexit.io/vancouver/?utm_campaign=tx-van-seb-1-week-countdown&utm_source=email&utm_medium=homepage-cta, those are the conversations you’re walking into (the real ones).

And with one week until Super Early Bird pricing ends https://techexit.io/vancouver/pricing/?utm_campaign=tx-van-seb-1-week-countdown&utm_source=email&utm_medium=register-cta, this is your moment to lock in the lowest rate to be in the room.

You’ll hear from founders and buyers who’ve lived the highs, the stalls, the pivots and the unexpected breakthroughs that define every acquisition story, the things they rarely talk about publicly.

**But Don't Just Take Our Word For It...**
