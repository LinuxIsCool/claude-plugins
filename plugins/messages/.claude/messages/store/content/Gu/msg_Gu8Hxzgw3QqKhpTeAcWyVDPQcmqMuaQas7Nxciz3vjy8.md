Shawn,

We are still feeling the energy from last weekend's

Convention & AGM  &mdash; and today, we get to share news that reflects exactly why this movement is growing.

Coming out of our record-breaking 2025 AGM, members voted with overwhelming support &mdash; 94.8% &mdash; to pass a

landmark motion  committing the BC Greens to oppose genocide, apartheid, systemic discrimination, and colonial violence, wherever they occur.

This makes us the first political party in British Columbia to take an unequivocal, principled stand against genocide &mdash; including the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people.

This is the kind of moral clarity our politics desperately needs.

As BC Greens Leader Emily Lowan said:

&ldquo;At a time when governments will not even acknowledge the reality of genocide in Palestine, the BC Greens are choosing to lead. We are choosing to say &mdash; without qualification &mdash; that all people deserve freedom, safety, dignity, and the right to live without state violence.&rdquo;

This moment belongs to every member, volunteer, and supporter who believes in courageous, values-driven politics. It is the product of thousands of conversations, years of organizing, and a community unwilling to look away from injustice.

And that spirit defined our entire Convention & AGM weekend.

From Friday night&rsquo;s overflowing kickoff social (and a surprisingly competitive round of speed-friending), to Saturday&rsquo;s 'Movement Camp' where we trained, strategized, and dreamed together, to Sunday&rsquo;s AGM where members charted the next steps for a stronger, more strategic Green movement &mdash; our weekend showed us what happens when hope becomes a discipline, and when people show up for each other.

Below are a few photos from across the events &mdash; snapshots of a movement that is growing in size, confidence, and purpose.

Last weekend, and this historic motion, showed what our movement is capable of when we act together.

Thank you for being part of this community, for your courage, and for everything you bring to this growing movement for a better future.

With gratitude,

Your BC Greens team
