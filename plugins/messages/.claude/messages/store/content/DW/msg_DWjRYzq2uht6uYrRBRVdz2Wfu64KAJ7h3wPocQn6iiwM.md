[TEC Token Sunset][2]

 GM! This post outlines the final implementation plan for the TEC token sunset. 
Sem and I are managing the technical execution, and I have to say, it’s great to be working with Sem again in the TEC :smiley: 

1. Snapshot Details (Important)

As stated in the previous forum post, To prevent last-minute speculation, the amount each address can claim will be based on: 
the LOWER of: 
(1) TEC balance held on July 23, 2025 (when the sunset plan was publicly announced), or 
(2) TEC balance at the dissolution date (when this proposal passes & the snapshot is taken). 
This means 2 things: 


People who sold TEC after July 23rd should really buy TEC back. 


Anyone who accumulated additional TEC after July 23 will have those excess tokens deducted from their final claimable amount, so those people should sell the TEC they bought. 


Here is a spreadsheet outlining the differences in balances from July 23rd and Nov 26th: 




2. Addresses Requiring Balance Deductions

If the final snapshot were ...

Griff - [TEC Shutdown Proposal][3]

 This all makes a lot of sense. I will support it with my TEC. 
It’s been a wild ride, and I really want to give a huge shout out to Gideon and the current stewards for all the incredible work that was done to not touch the common pool for 2 years. 
This is not normally how DAOs die… usually they get slowly drained by the stewards… instead you guys sacrificed and fought FOR YEARS to keep the DAO alive… It’s something that should be highlighted to your future employers that you shut down a DAO in a clean way without any shenanigans. 11/10 integrity.  I’m incredibly grateful for you all for carrying this dream. 
The TEC was just ahead of it’s time, I mean now 99% of tokens launched are on a version of an ABC  in 2021, it was more like 1%. I wonder how much second order effects the TEC had in making that a reality. 
Thank you again to @gideonro @natesuits @bear100 @rex & you are all heroes and I hope that this sacrifice is recorded and highlighted in the retrospective.

durgadas - [TEC Shutdown Proposal][4]

 I want to point out how many projects and ideas were spawned by the TEC-GravityDAO, City//Sync, and Omega groups, and I’ve continued to keep in touch with many people from those groups going forward. I would not work in crypto or at my current job at Octant if it hadn’t been for the TEC community’s encouragement, handholding, and empowerment. 
Everyone at the TEC who had to endure my newbie questions, silly ideas, and who saw the signal behind all my noise —I will forever appreciate you.

rex - [TEC Shutdown Proposal][5]

 gm all, 
I wanted to wait until the final day to share my thoughts; partly to give others space, and partly because I know I can come across strong-worded at times. I didn’t want my tone to distract from the proposal’s merits or its chance to pass cleanly. 
I’ve already flooded the forums in the past few months, so on this one, I mostly just want to express respect. Respect for the Coordination Team for moving this forward, for having the patience to navigate all the complexity, and for doing the unglamorous work of actually bringing the commons to closure in what has seemed like endless discussion. 
I’m in favor of this proposal, not because I want the TEC to end, but because I’d rather see a loving, intentional closure than a slow, confusing decay; despite the best efforts of us few remaining. The TEC deserves that kind of dignity. 
I do think the proposal is too lean on the post-mortem side, and would have liked to have seen more budget for a comprehensive analysis of the three majo...

rex - [TEC Shutdown Proposal][6]

 I’d like to second @gideonro 's point here - the Giveth Galaxy has supported the Commons in a plethora of ways. For example, and just in infrastructre terms, GG has continued to maintain all of the infrastructure since before the hatch (for free), including Telegram Bridge Bot, many of the Discord bots we were still using to some capacity, most of the TEC websites, our domain name! and even the forums we are currently discussing on. It is not fair to deem routing unclaimed assets to the Giveth Galaxy as charity. 
It will likely be a small number, as six months is plenty of time to claim. And it’s just as unfair to ask active token holders to return once more in six month’s time, especially with the difficulties we’ve already faced over the last three months in both quorum and support, to resolve then a small amount of funds.

Griff - [TEC Shutdown Proposal][7]

 Looks like the vote is up! 
Shout out to @natesuits @gideonro and @rex for working to figure out what was wrong with the infra to make this a reality!
