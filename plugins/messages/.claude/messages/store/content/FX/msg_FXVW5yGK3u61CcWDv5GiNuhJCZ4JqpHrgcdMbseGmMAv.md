Hello OFC Community,

As we move to the close of this immense, disruptive, and catalyzing year, we want to share our seeds of intention as we continue to cooperatively build momentum for a shared and emergent future.

This year at New York Climate Week, Open Future Coalition gathered partners, funders, technologists, and community leaders for Liberating our Future: Common Infrastructure for Collective Action. (https://www.openfuturecoalition.org/nycw25) Our focus together was to accelerate the co-development of shared infrastructure across three interconnected tracks—social, technical, and financial—exploring how collaborative partnerships can unlock the tools, relationships, and resources needed to strengthen resilience and scale community-led initiatives.

Together we highlighted how locally rooted solutions, community informed tools, global knowledge sharing, and coordinated investment can align to advance equitable, regenerative futures.

As a continuation of these conversations, we’re introducing a three-part virtual salon series designed to bring together diverse leaders and organizations shaping the landscape of collective action. These gatherings will showcase promising efforts already underway while creating space for cross-sector dialogue, shared sensemaking, and practical exploration of how common infrastructure can strengthen movements and enable greater cooperation across fields.

The series also sets the stage for the launch of our Developer & Practitioner Community in 2026—a collaborative hub for those building the social, technical, and financial systems that support collective action. Bringing together developers, practitioners, organizers, and researchers, this community will co-develop shared tools, exchange locally informed best practices, and steward cooperative governance frameworks through the Open Impact platform.

We look forward to continuing this journey with you as we deepen relationships, strengthen shared capacity, and build the infrastructures that can hold the futures we’re imagining together. As we take these next steps, we’re energized by the relationships and shared purpose emerging across our community, and we invite you to help shape what comes next.

For the future,
The Open Future Coalition Team

** Announcing the launch of our new Community Salon Series
------------------------------------------------------------

Join us for the first salon in our Common Infrastructure for Collective Action series, "From Connection to Coordination: Social Foundations of Collective Action"—an invitation to connect, cross-pollinate, and co-create the social systems that sustain just and thriving futures.

This virtual gathering will explore the social infrastructures that connect movements, organizations, and communities into living networks of mutual support, resource exchange, and shared learning. Through showcase examples and facilitated dialogue, we’ll highlight cooperative models, tools, and learning ecosystems that help networks act in coordination while remaining rooted in local autonomy—building the cooperative foundations of large-scale systems change.

Together, we’ll look at what it takes to coordinate across sectors and regions: stewarding knowledge, sharing resources, aligning governance practices, and strengthening the relationships that enable diverse actors to move toward shared purpose and common impact.
