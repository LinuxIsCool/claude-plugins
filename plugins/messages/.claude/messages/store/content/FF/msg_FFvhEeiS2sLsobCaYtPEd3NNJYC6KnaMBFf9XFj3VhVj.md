For our Yoga Gives Back Fundraising Efforts in 2025 we want to thank you for your generous support, we have been able to uplift more than 3,000 women and children in India this year. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿Your support inspires generational impact. Here is just one example. Meet Ruchita, one of YGB’s 440 SHE (Scholarship for Higher Education) students, featured in “Ruchita’s Journey.” After losing her parents young, she was raised by her grandmother, who earns about $20 a month making flower garlands. Her sister left school to help at home, and Ruchita nearly gave up on her own education—until she discovered YGB’s SHE scholarship. ﻿ Now in her second year of pre-college, she hopes to become an engineer and help other children in her community pursue education. Her grandmother, who never went to school, is proud to see her dreams grow. Together, these three women continue forward with strength and hope. Collectively, at YGB, our goal is to raise $50K to empower 3,500+ people in India through our programs — including scholarships for 440 underserved youths, micro-loans and the Pad Project for 550 mothers, safe homes and education for 600 children, and Science & Math resources for 800 students and teachers in remote government schools. ﻿This video shares more about the 18 Year Journey of Yoga Gives Back As we head towards the end of the year, it’s our last opportunity to ask for your help to start 2026 with great momentum. In the spirit of this holiday season, I’m writing to ask you to consider contributing to our year-end campaign by attending one of our events listed below or making a donation.
