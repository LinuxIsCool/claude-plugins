Dear Donors and kind Benefactors,

Last week I caught the flu, which also meant cancelling my friendsgiving dinner and nonprofit holiday party. Four days without screens and a quart of tea later, I’m both extremely grateful to the team that stepped up and encouraged me to focus on my health.

This year, we’ve raised an incredible $35,000 and $250,000 in-kind donations (housing, consulting, media, legal) so far and are now just $15,000 away from reaching our $300,000 year-end goal.

This $15,000 is going directly into the new cohort.

If we don’t hit this number, it means come January we can only support two of the five changemakers in our new cohort, who on average have run their nonprofits for 6 years.

If we succeed, TRIIBE will be supporting five new changemakers bringing us to a combined 61 years of nonprofit leadership and two Forbes 30 Under 30 founders in our program.

I can’t let them down, especially when most haven’t received a single grant this semester, which certainly speaks to the new financial gap this year has brought about.

Too often, the hard work and time investment for these NGOs is undone as students can’t easily sustain projects when they enter college life: heavier academic demands, fewer grants available after becoming an adult, and a sudden disconnection from prior support systems (friends, teachers, and family).

That’s where TRIIBE steps in, with a mission to support and develop the next generation of changemakers. We want to ensure that NGO’s created by youth are not only sustained with funding and mentorship, but supported by a community of like minded peers.

We’re in the final stretch of the year, and thanks to you, it’s been a year filled with impact, progress, and purpose. Your support has already helped us introduce our first cohort (all of whom I can proudly say are doing very well even amidst finals season), our first summit, forum, and half dozen other events, 8 branches copying our model across the globe, and our podcast. We couldn’t be more grateful.

Our youth projects and ideas are the future of a dignified and forward looking society, with projects addressing everything from youth to elder education, healthcare gaps, poverty alleviation, and a rising isolation pandemic.


You’ve showed up, donated generously, and earnestly believed in what we do, thank you. If you are able, please consider making a final contribution before the year closes. With corporate support coming from Steve Madden, Rayze, Allegiance Partners, 1PercentBack, and ESG News, you’re in great company.

We will keep you informed of our progress and look forward to sharing future changemakers and their projects in 2026.

Wishing you a healthy, peaceful holiday season,

Kyle Matthys

Chief Executive Officer
