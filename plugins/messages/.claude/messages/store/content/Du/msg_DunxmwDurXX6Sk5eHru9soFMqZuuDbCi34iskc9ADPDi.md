Hello Google Maps Platform customer,

We are writing to remind you that to streamline our development and release processes, and align with the evolving iOS ecosystem, we will be phasing out support for CocoaPods as an installation method for our Google Maps Platform iOS SDKs.

What you need to know

Key changes:

We will stop releasing new versions of the following Google Maps Platform iOS SDKs through CocoaPods:

   - Maps SDK for iOS[1]
   - Places SDK for iOS[2]
   - Navigation SDK for iOS[3]
   - Fleet Engine[4]

CocoaPods is in maintenance mode[5], and Swift Package Manager has become the preferred dependency manager for iOS development. Focusing on Swift Package Manager will allow us to dedicate more resources to improving the SDKs.

We will support releasing new Google Maps Platform iOS SDKs versions (for example: version 10.x.x) through CocoaPods until Q2 2026. Starting with version 11.0 of all Google Maps Platform iOS SDKs, new versions will not be released on CocoaPods.

Potential impact:

If you continue to use CocoaPods after Q2 2026, you will not be able to access the latest Google Maps Platform iOS SDKs versions, including new features, performance improvements, and critical bug fixes.

What you need to do

Action advised:

We encourage all developers currently using CocoaPods for Google Maps Platform iOS SDKs to begin planning their migration to Swift Package Manager or manual installation to ensure continued access to the latest updates.

Learn more about the Swift Package Manager installation instructions in the SDK documentation links above.

Impacted customers/accounts:

You are using the affected SDKs on the following projects:

   - active-thunder-339322

You may or may not be using CocoaPods in applications linked to those projects - only applications using CocoaPods are affected.

We’re here to help

We understand these changes may take some planning. If you have any questions or require assistance, please feel free to contact our support team at Google Maps Platform Support[6].

Thanks for choosing Google Maps Platform.
