Shawn, ﻿For many of us, 2026 is calling us to deepen and commit to a spiritual practice that includes a daily ritual of yoga, meditation and self-reflection. Perhaps it is in response to a world fraught with violence, poverty, corporate greed and political uncertainty. Cultivating and committing to a spiritual practice invites us to share and join with others collectively, to create a better world for all of us. Gaining mastery in our lives and developing inner sovereignty through the timeless wisdom of the ancient Indian sages is a path to understanding ourselves through a spiritual lens. I invite you to join me this year....
