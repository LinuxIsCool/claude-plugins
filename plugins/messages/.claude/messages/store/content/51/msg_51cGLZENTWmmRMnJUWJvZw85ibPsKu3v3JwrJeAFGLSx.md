Hi, gaiaaiagent!

It looks like you disabled two-factor authentication (2FA) on your npm account. 

2FA is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. We encourage users to setup 2FA on their accounts. To enable 2FA, please follow the instructions found here. https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-two-factor-authentication

If you have any questions or concerns please reach out to the npm support team. https://www.npmjs.com/support

You’re receiving this email because you recently disabled 2FA on your npm account.
