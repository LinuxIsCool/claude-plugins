Dear Masterminding EDEN Community,

We're excited to announce a new collaboration with Regen Tribe to co-design
a Regenerative Neighborhood & Community Framework in the lead-up to our
April 2026 gathering.

*Starting this Saturday, December 13*, we're launching a weekly call series
that will run through April, building the foundation for the work we will
expand upon at Masterminding EDEN

*When:* Every Saturday at 12:00 PM EST

*Register here:* https://www.linkedin.com/events/7405069389047181312/

We'll be taking a break the week of Christmas (December 28) and resuming
January 3, 2026.

*What We're Building*

Each call will focus on gathering resources, solutions, and collective
wisdom across five domains that map directly to our Masterminding EDEN
focus groups:

   - *Ecology:* Earth systems, regenerative agriculture, ecosystem
   restoration
   - *Hardware:* Built environment, energy, water, infrastructure
   - *Human Systems:* Health, education, safety, culture, governance
   - *Economy:* Regenerative finance, ownership models, exchange systems
   - *Software:* AI, digital twins, coordination technologies

*This Saturday's Call*

Our first call will be a soft opening where we'll share what we've gathered
so far, discuss how to structure the content, and explore how to bring more
specialists to the table. Come prepared to contribute your knowledge and
resources.

*How to Participate*

*Join the Calls* Saturdays at 12:00 PM EST

*Prepare to Contribute* Gather resources you know of for creating
regenerative neighborhoods and communities across five key areas: Ecology,
Hardware, Human Systems, Economy, and Software.

*Share in HIVE Groups* Start sharing resources in the focused content
repositories for each topic area: https://tribesplatform.app/hive/

This framework will become foundational material for our April gathering,
seed the EDEN Asset Library, and contribute to the framework development.
Your expertise and participation matter.

Looking forward to seeing you Saturday!

Warmly,
*Camara Cassin* Env. Sci Tech
