Dear Shawn,

**What happens when two founders hit a wall that so many entrepreneurs face and decide to build the solution themselves?**

For 

**Aria Hahn** and 

**Brianna Blaney**, the struggle to access funding wasn’t just frustrating; it was a catalyst.

What began as a pain point became a platform, and eventually, a company so impactful it caught the attention of 

**Deloitte Canada**, leading to one of 2025’s standout strategic acquisitions.

At TechExit.io Vancouver 2026 https://techexit.io/vancouver/?utm_campaign=tx-van-speaker-pocketed-spotlight&utm_source=email&utm_medium=homepage-cta, you’ll hear the Pocketed story 

**from the two women who lived every chapter of it.**

**Why Their Story Matters**

Pocketed's journey is a blueprint for:

* Turning a founder's frustration into a defensible product

* Scaling fast by delivering undeniable customer value

* Staying rooted in mission while navigating rapid growth

* Running a strategic, thoughtful acquisition process

* Building optionality long before the deal is on the table

**For founders thinking about funding, scaling or a future exit, this session will show what’s possible when grit, data, and timing align.**
