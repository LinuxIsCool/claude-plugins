Nov 20th Update
***************

----------
Hey Shawn,
----------

We’ve rolled out some new functionality to improve your Koyfin experience, and we’re excited to share it with you.

----------------------------------------
1. US Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs)
----------------------------------------

Koyfin now includes data for more than 11,000 US SMA strategies provided by Morningstar.

This lets you research and compare SMAs in the same workflow you already use for other asset types and easily bring them into portfolios, proposals, and client reports.

How this improves your workflow:

* Review SMA performance history
* See both net and gross SMA returns
* Check SMA exposure data
* Compare SMAs against benchmarks
* Include SMAs in allocation and exposure analysis

With everything in one place, SMA analysis becomes faster to prepare and easier to explain in client meetings.

-----------------------------------
2. Holdings Table in Client Reports
-----------------------------------

We added a Holdings Table to reports so you can present all underlying holdings for a portfolio in a clean, structured layout.

You can customize the columns and choose whether to show the secondary portfolio table, which makes it easy to tailor the view to each client.
