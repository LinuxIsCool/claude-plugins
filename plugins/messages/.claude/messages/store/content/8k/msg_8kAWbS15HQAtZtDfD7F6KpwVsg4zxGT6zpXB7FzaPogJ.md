For each release increment, I like to create 1 to 3 of these Learning
Expectations:

   - We believe: [describe the hunch/guess/assumption you want to better
   understand]
   - We will try: [describe what you will try to build evidence about your
   hunch/guess/assumption]
   - Our confidence will increase when: [describe the qualitative and/or
   quantitative evidence that will increase your confidence in your
   hunch/guess/assumption]
   - Our confidence will decrease when: [describe the qualitative and/or
   quantitative evidence that will decrease your confidence in your
   hunch/guess/assumption]
   - We expect to have sufficient evidence in: [the timeframe you expect to
   have enough evidence to evaluate this belief]
   - [optional] With increased confidence, next we would: [describe with
   increased confidence what you would try next]
   - [optional] With decreased confidence, next we would: [describe with
   decreased confidence what you would try next]
   - [optional] This is safe to try because: [describe how you will detect
   if what you’re trying is becoming unsafe and how you will recover from any
   negative side effects]
