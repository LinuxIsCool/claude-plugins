** Intro to Hair Suspension

This five-day, 21-hour workshop is your deep-dive into the art and technique of hair suspension. You’ll move through a blend of anatomy, postural health, nervous system support, rigging considerations, and the foundational skills for preparing and tying your own hair knot. Alongside lecture-based learning, you’ll train the physical conditioning and progressions needed for working toward self-suspension.

All hair knot equipment, a step-by-step illustrated guide, and a full digital handbook are included.

Cost: $550 + GST (15% off for members)

Early bird installment plan available: 3 equal payments of $180 + gst
