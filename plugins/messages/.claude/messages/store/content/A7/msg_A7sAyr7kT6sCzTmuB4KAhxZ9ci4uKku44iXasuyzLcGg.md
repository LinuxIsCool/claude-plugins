Welcome to npm, gaiaaiagent!

To complete your npm sign up, and as an additional security measure, you are requested to enter the one-time password (OTP) provided in this email.

The OTP code is: 58199467

We are also recommending that you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) with a trusted device so you will not be asked for an OTP over email with each log in.

2FA is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. With 2FA, you have to log in with your username and password and provide another form of authentication that only you know or have access to. 2FA also protects package publishing. When you publish a package from the command line you will be prompted to provide a generated token in order to do so.

To enable 2FA, please follow the instructions found here. https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-two-factor-authentication


If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to reach out to the npm support team. https://www.npmjs.com/support

You’re receiving this email because you recently created an npm account. If this wasn’t you, please ignore this email.

Thanks,
The npm team
