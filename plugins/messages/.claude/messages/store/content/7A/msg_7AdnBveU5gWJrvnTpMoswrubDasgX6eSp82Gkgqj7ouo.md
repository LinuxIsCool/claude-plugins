Koyfin Webinar

----------
Hey Shawn,
----------

Join us on Tuesday, December 9 at 3pm ET for a webinar on how advisors use Koyfin to review client portfolios, compare them to models, and prepare client-ready reports and proposals.

You’ll learn how to:

* Get client data into Koyfin: Upload a PDF statement or connect to a custodian or PMS to bring in holdings.
We currently support Schwab, Altruist, IBKR, Orion, and Black Diamond, with Fidelity and Addepar coming soon.* Compare & analyze portfolios: Review a client’s current portfolio against your models to identify performance, risk, and exposure gaps.
* Create client-ready materials: Turn your analysis into clean reports and proposals that make your recommendations clear.

This session is great for RIAs, wealth managers, and anyone who manages portfolios or prepares proposals. Register here ( https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Bs6cyfHvQZypXN4DSqOebw ):

Hope to see you there,
Rob
