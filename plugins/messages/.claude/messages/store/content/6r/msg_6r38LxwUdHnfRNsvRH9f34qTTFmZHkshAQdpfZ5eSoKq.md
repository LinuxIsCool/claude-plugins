"Sacred community brings us back to the heart﻿—where connection, compassion, and presence surround us like light in the darkest days." Returning to the Heart This Season As we move into the shorter days and the heart of the holiday season, we’re reminded of how nourishing it is to gather, breathe, and practice together. In these moments of shared presence, we rediscover the simple joys that come from slowing down and truly connecting. This time of year can be bright, busy, tender, or overwhelming—and it’s in community that we find steadiness, warmth, and a sense of belonging. When we come together, joy expands, presence deepens, and the threads of connection grow stronger. At the studio, our offerings this month are designed to support you through it all: space to ground, space to soften, and space to reconnect with what truly matters. Many of our events this month will be by donation to Yoga Gives Back - we appreciate your support of this amazing organization. Whether you join us on the mat, in stillness, or in celebration, we’re honoured to share this season of presence and heartfelt connection with you all. Love, All of us at Vancouver Island Yoga School SPACES STILL AVAILABLE! ﻿Welcome the new year with connection, joy, warmth, and renewed vitality in this popular workshop with Deborah.
