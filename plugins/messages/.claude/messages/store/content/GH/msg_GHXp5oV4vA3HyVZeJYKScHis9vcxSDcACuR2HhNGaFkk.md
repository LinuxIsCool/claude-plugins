** NEW Video! Canada’s newest National Park Reserve, Pituamkek on PEI!
------------------------------------------------------------
We are excited to share with you our new 3-minute video on Canada’s newest addition to the national parks system, the 3,000-hectare Pituamkek National Park Reserve on Prince Edward Island, to be co-managed by the Mi'kmaq and Parks Canada.

Watch this short interview featuring Chief Darlene Bernard (elected chief of the Lennox Island First Nation for 18 years, until June 2025) by the Endangered Ecosystem Alliance’s Ken Wu. The new national park reserve contains spectacular coastal wetlands, vegetated sand dunes, and Acadian old-growth forests, and will be expanded over time with various land acquisitions.

** NEEDED: A nature protection strategy for Canada
------------------------------------------------------------

We are watching closely to see whether Prime Minister Mark Carney follows through on his November 17th commitment in the House: “Consistent with our Kunming–Montreal commitments, the Nature Strategy will be released in the coming weeks.”

The federal government is expected to announce potentially significant policies and funding to expand Canada’s protected areas system. While details remain unknown, we hope the announcement includes:
* The reintroduction of the Nature Accountability Bill, which died on the order paper before the last election, that would enshrine Canada’s 30% by 2030 protection target in law.
* Canada’s 2030 Nature Strategy, a series of policies and guidelines to protect nature in Canada.
* Significant, renewed funding to ensure these commitments can be implemented.

Given that the Carney government has recently moved backward on many environmental policies and has used up their political capital in this regard, they are now more than ever expected by Canadians — and increasingly vulnerable to pressure — to deliver on nature protection.

Please take a minute to
SEND A MESSAGE (https://www.endangeredecosystemsalliance.org/news/natureaccountability2025?utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=85dd60187c-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_11_03_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-85dd60187c-446069664) to your federal MP right now urging strong action to protect ecosystems across Canada.

While you're at it, please also SEND A MESSAGE (https://www.endangeredecosystemsalliance.org/news/bc-protect-og-endangered-ecosystems?utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=85dd60187c-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_11_03_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-85dd60187c-446069664)  to the BC government to protect old-growth forests and endangered ecosystems.

Thank you, most gratefully as always 💚

For the Wild,

Ken Wu, Anne-Sophie Rodet, JoJo Beattie
