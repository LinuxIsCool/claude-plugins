At TechExit.io Vancouver 2026 https://cubebusinessmedia.acemlnb.com/lt.php?x=4lZy~GDGJ6bP6pJA0A25UOBs1K2mv_Yiw~gzX5XDU3SdD5OqzEy.0OJw1XRzit92kfY1bHPGIXeeT8DuyN5OVuncEu2i, we're bringing the conversations that matter most to the founders, operators, corp dev teams, advisors and investors who are actively shaping the future of Western Canadian tech.
