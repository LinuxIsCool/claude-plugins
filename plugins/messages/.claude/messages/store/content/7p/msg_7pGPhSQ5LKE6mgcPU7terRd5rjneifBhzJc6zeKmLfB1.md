 A note from Emily

Last month was a big one for the BC Greens, and I want to highlight some of what we&rsquo;ve accomplished together.


To start, we made history at our 2025 AGM when BC Green members passed BC&rsquo;s first-ever anti-genocide motion, officially opposing genocide, apartheid, and colonial oppression here at home and around the world. This motion passed with overwhelming support and reflects our shared commitment to justice, human rights, and dignity for all.


We've also been fighting hard against the reckless pipeline plans being pushed by Mark Carney and Danielle Smith &mdash; plans that would threaten BC&rsquo;s environment, coastal communities, and Indigenous Nations. The BC Greens have been clear: expanding fossil fuels isn&rsquo;t compatible with meeting our climate goals, and these projects put workers and the environment at risk. We&rsquo;re standing with the communities and Nations resisting these pipelines and fighting for a clean, publicly owned energy future.


And through the Cooperation and Responsible Government Accord (CARGA), our MLAs have secured real policy wins this fall. Proof that principled, persistent pressure can move this province forward. Congratulations to Jeremy, Rob, and our caucus team on the wrap of the fall session!

Looking ahead, the momentum from our Fight the Oligarchs tour has been incredible. Thousands of people have shown up across the province &mdash; rural, urban, northern, coastal &mdash; because they&rsquo;re ready for politics that puts people before billionaires and oligarchs. That energy is fuelling everything we&rsquo;re doing as we head into the final weeks of the year.


Now, we&rsquo;re focused on our most important year-end goal: raising

$1.32 million by December 31  so we can keep building this movement in every corner of BC. With your support, we can enter 2026 stronger than ever and ready for the fights ahead!


The BC Greens are turning momentum into real change. Thank you for being a part of it.


With hope in action,

Emily

 CARGA update


Our CARGA agreement with the government has brought fresh movement on democratic reform and climate accountability. Here&rsquo;s the quick version!
Democratic Reform &#128499;️

Rob helped lead a province-wide review on strengthening our democracy &mdash; with input from almost 1,000 people and organizations across BC.


The committee is recommending big changes like: a People&rsquo;s Assembly on proportional representation, exploring lowering the voting age to 16-17, and BC Elections being responsible for increasing voter turnout.


They&rsquo;re also calling for stronger safeguards against foreign interference and misinformation during elections.

Bottom line: smarter, fairer, more representative democracy in BC. Way to go, Rob!

CleanBC review 


Jeremy and our caucus played a crucial role in securing the Independent CleanBC Review through CARGA &mdash; a level of scrutiny the government had avoided for years. Thanks to their work, British Columbians finally have a clear, honest picture of what&rsquo;s holding our climate plan back.


The review points to what Jeremy and Emily have been warning: LNG expansion is the single biggest threat to meeting BC&rsquo;s climate goals. However, many of the recommendations simply don&rsquo;t go far enough. The BC Greens will push the government to implement the strongest recommendations and reject those that weaken accountability or entrench LNG expansion. Emily emphasized that she will use every tool available to ensure the review leads to action, not another cycle of delay.


We&rsquo;re incredibly proud of the leadership our MLAs showed in forcing this review and championing the strongest recommendations &mdash; from aligning CleanBC with UNDRIP, to strengthening methane rules, to giving the BCUC a real climate mandate. Their work ensures the science is front and centre, even when the government prefers politics over reality.

Why this matters &#128172;


Rob and Jeremy&rsquo;s work through CARGA continues to open doors for meaningful oversight and real improvements to some of BC&rsquo;s most important policies, from how we vote to how we tackle the climate crisis.
