gm Codex Community! 👋

Over the past few months, we've been working on some highly requested features for the Codex API (https://codex.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1d7bc25f5fbe059e05e4ce438&id=7efc4afaf3&e=bc3f687855) , such as:
* Token data for identifying coordinated trading activity and insider behavior
* Adding support for new networks (including Monad mainnet launch)
* Enhancing our wallet data capabilities
* Expanding support across multiple new launchpad protocols
* Updates to our API user dashboard, and more!

Let's take a look at all the details! 👇

⚠️ Bundlers/Snipers/Insiders Data Now Live!
------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Insider Detection for Launchpad Tokens

Combat coordinated buying activity and identify snipers and insiders on newly launched tokens with our comprehensive bundler, sniper, and insider detection data.

Key Features:
🔰 Bundlers: 4+ coordinated buys in the same block, helping detect coordinated buying activity from multiple wallets
🔰 Snipers: Wallets buying within 4 seconds of first swap, identifying bots and fast traders at launch
🔰 Insiders: Wallets receiving tokens directly from creators, identifying potential advance access
🔰 Label Persistence: Once a wallet is identified as a bundler/sniper/insider, that label persists across all tokens
🔰 Available in: filterTokens (https://codex.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1d7bc25f5fbe059e05e4ce438&id=e65c012fa0&e=bc3f687855) queries, onLaunchpadTokenEvent (https://codex.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1d7bc25f5fbe059e05e4ce438&id=e69059f8f6&e=bc3f687855) (& Batch (https://codex.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1d7bc25f5fbe059e05e4ce438&id=90af288ed8&e=bc3f687855) ) subscriptions (Latest SDK v1.0.40)
🔰 Coverage: All tokens launched after Nov 7 2025

ℹ️ Note: Different platforms use varying methodologies for determining this data, some of which is highly subjective. Codex prioritizes accuracy, so expect some discrepancies compared to other platforms.

Perfect for: Launchpad/memescope platforms, risk assessment tools, and anyone building advanced trading terminals.
