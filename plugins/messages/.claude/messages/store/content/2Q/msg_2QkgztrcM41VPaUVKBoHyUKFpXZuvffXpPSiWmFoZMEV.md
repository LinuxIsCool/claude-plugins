Dear Shawn ~

You have been invited to our *ECOSCENE Strategic Working Group session*,
along with a select group of several other dedicated and innovative leaders
in the global regeneration movement for planetary stewardship and
prosperity for all humanity.

Please find attached a special invitation letter for our session on
Saturday, November 22nd (11a – 2p MT).

The attached letter provides an overview of what we’ll be focusing on
together, and also requests that you prepare ahead of time by reviewing a
few documents, viewing a few videos, and listening to a podcast episode if
you’re able. The referenced materials are attached to this email and/or
linked in the letter.

Some of us will be joining in person and some via zoom – here is the zoom
link: *https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84626008449?pwd=zEdgGkTbKaN8zMRbFeQNOQ2sbtjkPs.1
<https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84626008449?pwd=zEdgGkTbKaN8zMRbFeQNOQ2sbtjkPs.1%20>*

We will take a 20-minute lunch break in the middle of the session, and will
provide pizza and salad (or something comparable) for those of us gathered
in person.

I’m tremendously grateful and excited to embark upon this journey with you
all ~ please kindly confirm that you’ll be in attendance!

In community,

Aaron

PS – BTW, for those of you familiar with Gene Keys, you may know or intuit
that this project is very anchored in the archetypal energy of *Gene Key 44
<https://genekeys.com/gene-key-44/>* - - I have a very interesting, if
arcane podcast episode on Key 44 I can share with you if you’re interested…
let me know and I’ll send you the link.
