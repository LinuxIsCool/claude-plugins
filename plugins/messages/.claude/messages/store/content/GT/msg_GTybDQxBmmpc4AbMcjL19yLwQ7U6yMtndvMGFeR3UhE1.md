* The Triangle Rewards Program is owned and operated by Canadian Tire
Corporation, Limited. Triangle® credit cards are issued by Canadian Tire Bank.
Rewards are in the form of electronic Canadian Tire Money® (CT Money®). To
collect bonus CT Money you must present a Triangle Rewards card/key fob, or use
any approved Cardless method, at time of purchase or pay with a Triangle credit
card. You cannot collect paper Canadian Tire Money on bonus offers. Any bonus
multiplier is based on the base rate of collecting CT Money (0.4%), and will be
added to whatever the Member would otherwise collect, without the bonus.
Example: On a $100 (pre-tax) purchase with a 20x bonus multiplier a Member would
earn a bonus $8 in CT Money (20 X 0.4% X $100). Not all items sold are eligible
to earn CT Money or to be redeemed for. Conditions apply. Visit triangle.com for
full program rules and Partner location information. The offered rate is
exclusive of any bonus or promotional offers or redemption transactions. Minimum
purchase of $250 or more required to receive the 20x bonus. Minimum $250 spend
is on the pre-tax amount on the same tender and for a single transaction. $250
must be spent on items that earn CT Money. CT Money is collected on the pre-tax
amount of the purchase. Bonus CT Money may take up to 5 weeks to be applied to
the Member’s Triangle Rewards Account. No rainchecks.
