Hi @LinuxIsCool,

We noticed your personal access token (classic) "regenai" with repo scope will expire in 6 days.

If this token is still needed, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/2541481516/regenerate to generate an equivalent.

If you run into problems, please contact support by visiting https://github.com/contact

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
