Dear IBKR Client,
 Welcome to Interactive Brokers!

Your account UXXXXX201 is approved but you will need to fund your account to access market data and trade your account.

During the application process you created a deposit notification that indicated you would contact your bank or broker to move funds into your account. Deposit notifications allow us to efficiently identify your incoming funds for proper credit to your account but do not move any funds.

If you have not done so already, please contact your bank or broker to move the funds to your account.
To check funding status, please log in to your account.
       Log in to Your Account ( https://www.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login?c=t ) 	   Thank you for opening an account with Interactive Brokers. We look forward to your business.
   Interactive Brokers
