Your parent can now help manage your ChatGPT settings.
                       Co Ad can now help manage your ChatGPT settings

      Now that parental controls are set up, your parent can adjust a few
things to help shape how ChatGPT works for you. Here's how you can get
started together:

  *Review your settings together*

  Open your ChatGPT settings and select *Parental controls*. From there,
you can see what settings your parent can manage, like:

   -  Setting quiet hours when ChatGPT can't be used
  -  Reducing sensitive content
  -  Turning on or off features like voice mode or image generation
  -  Choosing whether your chats and files are used to help improve our
models

  If you unlink accounts, parental controls will turn off — and your
parent will be notified.

  *What stays private*

  Parental controls won't give your parent direct access to your
conversations with ChatGPT, and they are not designed to track or monitor
activity.

  *Safety notifications*

  We care about your safety and well-being. ChatGPT may send a safety
notification to your parent or guardian in certain limited situations —
if our systems and trained reviewers detect activity that may indicate
certain serious safety concerns involving self-harm.

  *Questions? We're here to help.*
