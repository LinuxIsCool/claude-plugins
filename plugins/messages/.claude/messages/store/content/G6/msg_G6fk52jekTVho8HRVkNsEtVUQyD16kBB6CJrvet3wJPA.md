Hi Shawn,

First, thank you. If you are one of the 676 people who donated since December began, you&rsquo;re helping push this campaign toward its year-end goal with real momentum. Every single contribution is truly making a difference. And thanks for sticking with us through this stretch of emails! Your attention and engagement mean everything right now.

We&rsquo;re now just two days away from the Victoria stop of the Fight the Oligarchs tour &mdash; our biggest rally of the year &mdash; and this is your

final reminder to RSVP :

&#128467;️ Sunday, December 14
⏰ 3&ndash;5:30 PM (check-in 2:30 PM)
&#128205; United Commons, Victoria


https://click.email.bcgreens.com/?qs=a671043a84f6a001ed5300eebdab5862d296429b49526bd232f4d04d1b21b3a1a9e7f2df794d016b28be79cb47e6279ab8edc9723eb83264 
LET'S RALLY! 


Emily will be sharing what she&rsquo;s heard across the province, the stories shaping her vision for 2026, and why people power is the only antidote to the billionaire influence warping our politics. 

This rally is the crescendo of the tour, Shawn &mdash; and a moment to show just how strong this movement is.

So if you can be there 
https://click.email.bcgreens.com/?qs=a671043a84f6a001ed5300eebdab5862d296429b49526bd232f4d04d1b21b3a1a9e7f2df794d016b28be79cb47e6279ab8edc9723eb83264 
in person , we would truly love to have you. This movement is built by people showing up for each other.

And if you can't attend, you can still be part of the momentum by 
https://click.email.bcgreens.com/?qs=a671043a84f6a001a69ac4f9418d7a114d0b285823ccb1cab9a0a5ae2baeae361f77a0d43c04833d0f283be820896ad2cd970ff3f8f649e8 
making a year-end gift , if you haven't already. This rally is a key moment in our year-end fundraising push, and we&rsquo;re counting on supporters across BC to help get us over the finish line.

We&rsquo;re also hosting a Dutch auction at the rally: an open invitation for anyone who&rsquo;s able to chip in at whatever level works for them. Every amount truly helps, and no one is expected to participate if it&rsquo;s not accessible. People power is what carries this movement!
