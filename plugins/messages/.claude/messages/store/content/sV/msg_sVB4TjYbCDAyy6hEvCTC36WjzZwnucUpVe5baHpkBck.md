Mapbox Geofencing for iOS and Android makes it simpler to configure and manage geofenced areas and monitor when a device enters, exits, or remains within them. Events can then trigger personalized actions, alerts, and notifications based on a user’s real-time location.

 

Mapbox Geofencing has several advantages over other solutions:

* Monitoring is handled on the client side, allowing it to function both online and offline.
* Monitoring happens in both foreground and background modes
* No set limits on the number of geofences that can be managed
* Support for point-radius and complex geometries that enable precise monitoring of intricate spaces
Android and iOS geofencing services both have platform-specific implementation differences. Third-party geofencing products often need to be integrated into a wider location platform, like Mapbox. With Mapbox Geofencing, customers unite their geofencing solution with their wider platform, saving dev time and effort by eliminating complex third-party integrations.
