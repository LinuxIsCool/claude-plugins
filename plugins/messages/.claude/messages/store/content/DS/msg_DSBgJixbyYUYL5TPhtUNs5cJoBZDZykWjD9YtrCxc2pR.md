***And this one too.... :-)
~A

Dear Friends ~

I am deliberately "bcc'ing" .... (although many of us already know one
another, and others will be meeting for the first time, and we look forward
to ample and robust "mycelial" exchanges among and between our entire group
going forward) in order to have each of you take some solo time to prepare,
and to reflect and envision what you would want to see ECOSCENE do,
accomplish and/or have as its core "DNA" / "way of being" in the world and
in service to humanity and to our living planet.

***Please take some quiet / reflective time to consider 3-5 features /
aspects / elements / foundational commitments / etc., that we can consider
together for ECOSCENE.***

*BONUS MATERIAL:*

In addition to the requested reading and watching/listening in the previous
invitation letter and attachments, we encourage you to check out the
following:

   - *Eckhart Tolle at Google* - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE1dWwoJPU0
   - *Y on Earth* chapters:* "Unplug," "Envision," and "Culture" *

There are decades and lifetimes of compiled and polished resources in our
recommendations list, and we each have the opportunity to "stand on the
shoulders of giants" the extent to which we take time to absorb the
information and wisdom shared with you... it especially behooves us not to
"reinvent any wheels" in these momentous, critical, and auspicious times,
and to focus as much of our time, energy, and attention to the higher-order
inner work, visioning work, and creative collaborative work and play we're
being invited to experience and cultivate together.

Looking forward,
Aaron
