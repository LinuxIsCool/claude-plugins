Shawn,
The fall legislative session has wrapped &mdash; and our small but mighty BC Green caucus knocked it out of the park.
Your BC Green MLAs, Jeremy Valeriote and Rob Botterell, stayed focused, disciplined, and effective this Fall session (even as the BC Conservatives descended into familiar chaos...). With just two seats and a ton of tenacity, they delivered outsized wins for people, climate, and communities across BC.

And that impact? It&rsquo;s thanks to you.

Because you chose to support this movement, your MLAs were able to show exactly what principled, people-first leadership looks like.

Here&rsquo;s some of what your support made possible:

- Put climate accountability back on the agenda. Rob and Jeremy exposed major loopholes in the weakened CleanBC plan &mdash; calling out the government&rsquo;s LNG-friendly math and demanding real, science-based climate action.

- Introduced legislation to ban greenwashing ads. Jeremy tabled the Greenwashing Prevention Act &mdash; a simple premise with real teeth: if a company claims something is &ldquo;green,&rdquo; they should have to prove it.

- Fought for clean air protections. Our caucus continued pushing for a Clean Air Act to safeguard indoor and outdoor air quality in schools, hospitals, and communities increasingly hammered by wildfire smoke.

- Defended renters. We kept vacancy control and housing justice on the table, challenging speculation-driven policies that put affordability further out of reach for working families.

- Protected democracy through electoral reform. Rob helped ensure the Electoral Reform Committee advanced ideas like lowering the voting age and strengthening fair representation &mdash; putting people, not political machines, first.

- Stood up to harmful involuntary care expansion. While government rushed to broaden involuntary detention for youth, your Green MLAs called out the risks, demanded evidence-based legislation, and amplified families, clinicians, and advocates sounding the alarm.

- Winning long-overdue fairness for people with disabilities. Working through the CARGA agreement, your Green MLAs helped secure the end of spousal caps and clawbacks in BC&rsquo;s disability-assistance system &mdash; a change that means couples will no longer lose income simply because they are together. It&rsquo;s a hard-fought win that Greens, advocates, and impacted communities have pushed for over years.

Not bad for two MLAs, a rockstar caucus team, and a whole lot of grit!

Now, as we close out the year, we&rsquo;re shifting our focus to what comes next. 2026 is a defining year for this movement, and we need to enter it strong, organized, and ready to build on this momentum.

That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve set a year-end fundraising goal of $1.32 million. 

Yes, it&rsquo;s ambitious. But so is everything we&rsquo;re taking on: challenging fossil-fuel interests, pushing for real climate action, fighting for housing justice, and growing a Green presence in every region of our province.

If you believe in what Jeremy, Rob, and the whole BC Green team delivered this session &mdash; and if you want to see us scale it &mdash; your support today truly matters.

FUEL THE MOVEMENT 


Thank you for standing with us through a packed, high-impact session. We&rsquo;re proud of what we achieved together, and even more determined for what&rsquo;s ahead!

With gratitude,

Your BC Greens team


P.S. Rob and Jeremy pushed far beyond what anyone expects from a two-member caucus.

Your gift today honours that work  &mdash; and fuels the next chapter of it in 2026. Thank you.
