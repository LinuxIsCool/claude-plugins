Dear Friends ~

<https://yonearth.org/ourbiggestdeal/> is officially published, and we're
hosting a world-wide VIRTUAL BOOK LAUNCH CELEBRATION this Wednesday (12/10)
at 11a MT!]

At this special one hour event, you'll hear from several of the
contributing authors (*Hunter Lovins, Alena Maslova, Riane Eisler, Aaron
Perry*, and more), and will hear about the dozens of mission-driven
companies and organizations achieving deep systems change at scale through
economic, financial, philanthropic, and place-based structures, strategies,
and approaches.

And, we'll be giving away FREE ebook copies to ALL attendees as well as a
free printed copy of Our Biggest Deal <https://yonearth.org/ourbiggestdeal/>

together.
