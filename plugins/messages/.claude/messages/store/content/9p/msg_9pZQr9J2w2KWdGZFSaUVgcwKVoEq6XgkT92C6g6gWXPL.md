A MOMENT OF CHOICE
We are at an inflection point. Every major technology, from radio to
the internet, has amplified both our hopes and our fears. Artificial
intelligence may change the course of human history, but like all
technologies, it will carry the imprint of the systems and worldviews
that bring it into being. Whatever the future holds, its impact will
be shaped by the intention, mindset, and worldview of those who design
and use it.

_IF WE WANT A FUTURE THAT IS REGENERATIVE RATHER THAN EXTRACTIVE,
RELATIONAL RATHER THAN REDUCTIONIST, AND LIFE-GIVING RATHER THAN
OPTIMIZING FOR EFFICIENCY ALONE, WE MUST DESIGN IT THAT WAY —
TOGETHER._

INTRODUCING _AI WITH LIFE_ – MORE THAN A BOT 
With Life is launching an exploration to create an AI With Life — a
practical, community-led journey to discover how AI can align with
life and regeneration. More than a bot, this is a community research
initiative that builds on the Regenerative Technology and Regenerative
AI Ethics working groups started by members of the With Life Community
and Capital Institute alumni and will continue to grow through deep
collaboration and partnership. Partners like Jessica Groopman and the
Regenerative Technology Project, Caroline Chubb Calderon (AYU and
Regenerative AI Ethics), Grant Storry (Kiirin AI and Elemental), and
others will steward and advise this project to foster coherence among
the fragmented conversations in the AI and Regeneration movements.

 

THE FIRST PROTOTYPE

We’re starting with a practical tool that everyone can use and test.
The first prototype launches alongside JOHN FULLERTON’S NEW BOOK,
_REGENERATIVE ECONOMICS: REVOLUTIONARY THINKING FOR A WORLD IN CRISIS_
[https://nrhythm.krtra.com/c/pvyRgXdjcu9c/ze4x]. The
prototype is uniquely tuned to the book as well as more than a decade
of Capital Institute content.

 

The next phase will develop a REGENERATIVE BUSINESS COMPANION, tuned
to nRhythm’s work on designing, managing, and monitoring a business
as a living system. Over time, the project will grow to include other
With Life community content and be continually informed by our
collective inquiry and learning as a broader community.

WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT

To bring this work to life, we’ve launched a CROWDFUNDR CAMPAIGN to
raise $300,000 for the first phase of this research. We’re using the
platform not only to fund development but also to reach beyond our
current community and invite a broader network of innovators,
practitioners, and allies to join us. Every contribution helps expand
the reach of this learning journey and strengthens the shared
exploration of what an AI in service to life could become.

HELP US MAKE THIS CAMPAIGN GO VIRAL! EVERY CONTRIBUTION AND SHARE WILL
HELP SPREAD THE WORD AND GROW THIS MOVEMENT.
