Hello Shawn,



[http://cdn.mcauto-images-production.sendgrid.net/c3204eab2ef0ebe2/56b4006b-14b1-41c6-b3c0-0f20628dd912/1216x1115.png]

Swipe Your Way to Connections with Veggly
[https://www.veggly.net/discover-vegglys-new-swipe-experience-more-intuitive-fluid-and-fun/]


We’re thrilled to introduce Veggly’s new swipe functionality and our refreshed,
modern design — created to make your experience smoother, faster, and more
intuitive than ever.
With this update, you now have multiple ways to interact with each profile,
giving you more freedom and a more natural flow while browsing:


🌱 Swipe the profile or the colored slider bar to the right to send a Like.
💚 Swipe to the left to send a Super Like and stand out instantly.
👀 Swipe the center circle downward to hide the profile whenever you’re not
interested.


This redesigned interaction brings a cleaner look, a more fluid movement, and an
overall improved browsing experience. Whether you prefer swiping the entire card
or using the new slider bar, everything is built to feel intuitive from the very
first moment.


And of course — for anyone who prefers the classic style — you can still tap the
Like and Super Like buttons just like before. Nothing has been removed; we’ve
only added new ways to connect so you can choose whichever method feels right
for you.


Enjoy a fresh, fun, and upgraded Veggly as you get closer to finding your
VegLove! 💚🌱Read more about it here.

Across Borders, Into Forever: Himaani & Karthik’s Story


On this #OurVegMatch story, we’re excited to share the journey of Himaani and
Karthik—a couple who proved that love knows no borders. 🌱💚


They matched on Veggly while Himaani was in India and Karthik in Sweden. From
their first conversation, sparks flew, bonding over their vegan lifestyles and
love for animals. Just 20 days later, Karthik flew 15+ hours to meet Himaani in
Goa—turning a joke into a real-life meeting!


Three months after that, they celebrated a magical vegan wedding in a Swedish
castle on June 1st, 2023, surrounded by friends in person and family joining
live from India. Since then, their love has only grown, with a second ceremony
in India, a new home, and plans to expand their vegan family.
