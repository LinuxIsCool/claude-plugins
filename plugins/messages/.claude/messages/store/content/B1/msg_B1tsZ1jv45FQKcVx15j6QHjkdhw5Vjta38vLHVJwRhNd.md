**Happy Monday and welcome back to Early Access by Coeus Collective: **the newsletter where we do the sourcing and you get the deal.** **

[Last week we told you about Loopini,](https://coeuscollective.beehiiv.com/p/early-access-loopini) a protein-packed frozen pizza with macros that you have to see to believe. But today, we’re going back from the table to the screen. Even more specifically, your video call interface. 

What if you could power-up your sales calls with an invisible AI assistant that responds to objections and gives you valuable feedback in real-time?

And no, this isn’t the viral startup Cluely. In our eyes, this one is better. No need to “cheat on everything” like Cluely says to: instead, just win deals faster. Welcome to Curvo.

Sales happens in the moment, but most of the tools that sales teams rely on (like CRMs and analytics reports) are stuck in the past.

You simply do not have enough time to wait until the end of the call to see the insights that will make or break the deal.

This is the pain point that Co-Founder & CEO Leo Rogers seeks to eliminate with Curvo, which refers to itself as “the first real-time operating system for sales teams.”

Curvo is an agentic sales coach that sits live in virtual meetings through a desktop app. The startup’s mission is to equip sales teams with real-time intelligence and coaching that is privately visible inside the live conversation. Curvo’s vision is to redefine how sales teams operate by “empowering every rep to perform like the top 1%.” It does this by drastically reducing the latency between insight and action, giving reps the winning playbook at the exact moment they need it.

Curvo takes tools and dashboards that were originally fragmented and creates a unified, AI-first system built for performance in the moment. As a desktop app, Curvo works as a transparent overlay in your virtual meeting, offering sub-second nudges and a range of flexible widgets. It can all be customized and tailored to the specific needs of the sales playbook. Curvo’s deal intelligence feature displays metrics like talk time distribution and talk speed; it also aligns the conversation to sales frameworks like MEDDPICC and BANT.

Within the sales industry, there are large and growing market tailwinds for AI-based sales tools. The conversation intelligence software market is projected to grow from US$25.3 billion in 2025 to US$55.7 billion by 2035 (CAGR 8.2%).[ ](https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/conversation-intelligence-software-market?utm_source=chatgpt.com)Specific to sales, the AI-enabled sales conversation market is projected to grow from $2.3B in 2024 to roughly $12.8B by 2033 (CAGR 20.7%) This momentum reflects a broader shift: AI sales tools are no longer just nice to have. For many companies, they’re becoming a foundational part of how sales teams operate.

Curvo sits at the intersection of a new category, the $23B blank space between conversation intelligence and sales coaching. In our opinion, this space specifically represents the future intersection of AI and sales. 

In the performance-enhanced AI era, sales teams will want more than just fragmented tools that automate mundane tasks: they will want an AI assistant that behaves like a real coach, helping them close deals and improve performance in real time.

Curvo’s target customer base consists of software companies with 100+ sales reps and multi-product SaaS solutions that are already using conversation intelligence tools (just without real-time information capabilities). Curvo launched their desktop app in Q1 of 2025 and acquired their first enterprise customers in Q2. 

Curvo shares the competitive landscape with other emerging real-time AI assistants, most notably the viral Roy Lee-led Cluely. While both platforms provide live in-call conversation intelligence driven by AI, a closer look reveals a significant difference in the sophistication of their operating systems. 

Where other tools offer a foundational layer of real-time monitoring, Curvo provides a more developed and actionable experience. Curvo's deep context engine delivers sub-second, dynamic nudges and seamlessly integrates structured sales frameworks, such as MEDDPICC, directly into the live conversation. This level of immediate guidance means that sales teams using Curvo move faster from raw data to high-impact action, ensuring sales reps get the most out of their real time assistant.

Curvo is led by a team with extensive experience in scaling B2B SaaS, sales, and AI.

Co-founder & CEO [Leo Rogers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-rogers/) is a serial entrepreneur in the tech industry. He previously built a product design agency that delivered 130+ high-performing products used by 30M+ users, and co-founded an AI-powered creator economy marketplace.

Co-founder & CPO [Anuj Bhargava](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anujbhargava/) pioneers the AI product vision, drawing on his extensive leadership in product and design from working at five global unicorns. He was previously Head of Design at Flipkart, which was acquired by Walmart in 2018.

They are backed by a strong technical team, including Shubha Roychowdhury (Head of Data Science) who has 15+ years of experience in data science and machine learning, and Ben Wallman (Head of Engineering) who brings 10+ years of experience building full-stack applications.

Caption: 

Curvo targets one of the most expensive and frustrating problems in sales: the lag between having data and taking action. 

They call their solution the Agent-Graph Advantage. When compared to competing solutions like Gong or Glyphic, Curvo utilizes deep context and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning, while their competitors’ technologies are typically limited to 1-2 hop pattern matching. 

This allows Curvo to analyze 100% of unstructured data and organizational knowledge for real-time actionable insights. For high-stakes, complex enterprise sales, this capability is a game changer.

The primary risk lies in the accuracy of execution. The success of an AI coaching platform hinges on user adoption; without trust in Curvo’s guidance, sales reps are unlikely to implement it effectively. As a new technology, a long enterprise sales cycle for their own product may await Curvo. 

The early signs, though, suggest a strong path forward: the product aligns with growing market trends, fits naturally into existing sales workflows, and addresses a problem that no other platform has successfully provided a solution for.

Curvo is raising $3M in seed financing and has 50% of the round currently committed, primarily from sales industry vets from companies like Adobe, SAP, and DocuSign, who are angel investing in a technology that they think can change the game for their industry.
