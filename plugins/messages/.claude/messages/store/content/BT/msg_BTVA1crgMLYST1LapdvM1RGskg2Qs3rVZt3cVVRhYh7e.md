Why durability, efficiency and real AI capability will define the next generation of winners.https://techexit.io/blog/ 

TechExit NOW #70  •  December 4, 2025

****Hello TechExit.io Community!****

At 

**TechExit.io Toronto**, the “Brains & Bots” session brought together three people who sit at the centre of the capital stack; 

**David Rozin (Scotiabank/Roynat Capital), Hugues Lalancette (Inovia Capital)** and 

**Thomas Terrats (Vessel),** moderated by 

**Michelle McBane (StandUp Ventures)**.

What unfolded wasn’t a conversation focused on AI predictions https://techexit.io/blog/5-lessons-on-the-new-face-of-venture-capital-from-techexit-io-toronto/?utm_campaign=tx-issue-70&utm_source=email&utm_medium=blog-cta. It was a candid look at how AI is rewriting the economics of building a company, the expectations investors now have and what founders must do to stay competitive in a market that is moving faster than most companies can adapt.

The panelists described a venture world in transition: LPs holding back, funds reinventing their workflows, founders questioning whether they even need VC at all and competitive moats shrinking with every new model release.

It was a discussion grounded in lived experience (deals falling apart, valuations shifting, diligence changing) and one message came through clearly: 

**the old growth playbook doesn’t work in the AI era.**

**Key Takeaways:**

* AI has lowered the cost of building and raised the bar for durability

* Growth expectations for AI-native companies now stretch far beyond SaaS norms

* Retention has become the ultimate signal of resilience against model disruption

* AI greenwashing is a deal-killer; transparency matters more than narrative

* Canada faces an inflection point that will determine its role in the global AI economy
