Hello,

We're releasing two new features that make writing and fixing code faster: a browser-based layout editor and Debug Mode.

Browser Layout Editor

Design and code simultaneously with the new layout and style editor ( https://cursor.com/blog/browser-visual-editor ) built into the Cursor browser. Drag and drop components, update colors using your design system, build layouts and grids, and add shadows or gradients as needed.

Once the design is perfect, click “Apply” to delegate your visual changes to the agent.

Debug Mode

Debug Mode ( https://cursor.com/blog/debug-mode ) is a new way to fix tricky bugs. Instead of writing new code, prompt the agent with a description of the issue. Then, the agent explores your codebase, adds instrumentation, and uses runtime logs to find and fix the root cause.

Try Debug Mode and everything else new in Cursor 2.2 ( https://cursor.com/changelog/2-2 ).

We’re excited to see how you use it!

Best,
Cursor Team
