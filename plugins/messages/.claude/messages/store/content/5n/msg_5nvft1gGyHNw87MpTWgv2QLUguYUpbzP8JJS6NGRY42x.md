**Happy Monday! Welcome back to Early Access by Coeus Collective: **the newsletter where we do the sourcing and you get the deal.** **

[Last week we told you about Curvo,](https://coeuscollective.beehiiv.com/p/early-access-curvo) an AI video call assistant taking on Cluely with a sales-specific focus. Today, for our last traditional Early Access newsletter of the year, we’re staying in the AI realm to tell you about a startup in our network that is set to revolutionize the multi-trillion dollar construction industry: Ulama.

Tyce and the Ulama team is one we’ve been watching for a while since he won our Coeus Collective Pitch Showcase Presented by Seedlegals with support from J.P. Morgan Innovation Economy during New York Tech Week by a16z this past June. 

Ulama is now currently fundraising and we’re excited to tell you all about the company. Alright, let’s get to it!

Caption: Ulama’s product in action.

There is an ongoing legislative debate about what the government’s role in homebuilding should be. Subsidies, zoning reform, tax incentives, and public private partnerships tend to dominate the conversation. But underneath these policy discussions sits a far more operational constraint that determines whether housing actually gets built at all: permitting.

In a world shaped by a seemingly permanent housing shortage, delays are often not caused by a lack of capital or demand. Instead, they emerge from the friction between architectural design and regulatory compliance. Building codes are complex, vary by jurisdiction, and continue to expand in scope. Today, most compliance review remains manual, slow, and reactive, forcing architects and builders into costly revision cycles after plans are already submitted.

This is the gap Ulama is designed to address.

Ulama’s core function is to automatically identify building code violations directly within an architect’s design, allowing teams to resolve issues before submitting plans for permit approval. Rather than waiting weeks or months for feedback from reviewers, architects can design with compliance in mind from the very beginning.

By tightening the feedback loop between design and regulation, Ulama can significantly reduce permitting timelines, one of the most overlooked constraints in the global housing supply chain. At scale, faster approvals do more than save time and money. They unlock the ability to build more housing, more predictably, in cities and regions facing acute shortages.

The pressure to build has never been higher. Housing shortages have become a defining economic and political issue, driving up costs, constraining labor mobility, and reshaping local economies. In response, governments are actively searching for ways to increase supply without compromising safety, accessibility, or environmental standards.

One visible signal of this shift is the growing influence of YIMBY policies. Support for building more housing now cuts across political lines, with cities and states experimenting with zoning reform, density allowances, and faster approvals. The common thread is clear. Policymakers want housing projects to move from concept to construction more quickly.

At the same time, the permitting process has not meaningfully evolved. Even as regulations change upstream, building code compliance remains complex, fragmented, and largely manual. Architects and builders are still forced into reactive workflows where violations are discovered only after submission, triggering costly revisions and long delays. 

This is a costly process as a whole: the global cost of permit activities itself is $700B according to the Ulama team!

This tension between pro-housing policy and outdated permitting infrastructure creates a critical opportunity. As more projects enter the pipeline, the cost of inefficiency compounds. Faster zoning approvals lose their impact if permitting remains slow and unpredictable.

So, as housing, infrastructure, and regulatory complexity rise together, Ulama’s ability to empower builders to build efficiently without lowering standards is a competitive advantage.

Demand for Ulama’s product has already begun to build.

Today, more than sixty architecture and design firms are on Ulama’s waitlist, indicating strong inbound interest from practitioners who want compliance integrated earlier in the design process. 

On the execution side, Ulama has completed ten pilot projects, giving the team real world exposure to how building codes are interpreted, applied, and challenged across live designs. 

Ulama has also secured early funding and backing through the MetaProp Accelerator, placing the company inside a real estate focused ecosystem that provides direct access to developers, owners, and industry operators. 

Finally, Ulama has signed a letter of intent tied to a design partnership, signaling a path from pilots to long term commercial engagement. As regulatory pressure increases and more projects enter the pipeline, these early commitments position Ulama to convert interest into sustained usage.

Taken together, Ulama’s traction suggests a product being pulled into the market rather than pushed. The company is embedding itself directly into the workflows of firms that cannot afford delays, making compliance speed and accuracy a core operational advantage rather than an afterthought.

Ulama is addressing a real and costly failure point in the construction lifecycle. Permitting friction is not a surface level inconvenience. It is a structural constraint that compounds risk, delays capital deployment, and limits housing supply. A product that meaningfully reduces this friction has the potential to become core infrastructure rather than a nice to have tool.

From a scalability standpoint, Ulama is well positioned. Its SaaS delivery model allows it to expand across geographies without the linear cost structure of traditional compliance services. Its integration into Revit is particularly important, as Revit is already embedded in the daily workflows of the vast majority of architectural firms. This positions Ulama as an extension of existing behavior rather than a tool that requires teams to change how they work.

There are other companies operating in adjacent parts of the market, most notably Archistar, which has raised more than thirty five million Australian dollars to date. However, Ulama appears differentiated in how directly it embeds compliance into the act of design itself. Rather than functioning as an external review layer, Ulama focuses on surfacing issues in real time so architects can resolve them before submission. That shift from review to prevention is meaningful.

There are also clear challenges ahead. Granting third party software access to private architectural designs raises legitimate security and trust concerns, particularly for firms working on sensitive or high value projects. Additionally, building codes vary not only by region but often by interpretation, creating ongoing complexity in maintaining accurate and current rule sets.

These challenges are inseparable from the size of the opportunity. If Ulama can build trust around data security and demonstrate reliable coverage across jurisdictions, it has the potential to become a foundational layer in how buildings are designed and approved.** In a world where pressure to build faster continues to rise, software that enables speed without sacrificing standards stands to win long term.**
