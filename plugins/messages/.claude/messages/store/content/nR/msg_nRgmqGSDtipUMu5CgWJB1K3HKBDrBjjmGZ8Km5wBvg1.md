Better code generation, plus new features for your workflow.



 <https://claude.ai>



Today, we’re announcing Claude Opus 4.5 
<https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5>, the best model in the world 
for coding. We’re also launching improvements to Claude Code to help you 
execute long-running and parallel tasks, plus more Claude features for using 
Opus 4.5 for professional work.



Here’s what we’re launching on Claude Code:

 * Claude Code on Desktop: Run multiple local and remote Claude Code sessions 
in parallel from thedesktop app <https://www.claude.com/download>, now in beta. 
You can have one agent fixing bugs in your local repo, another researching on 
GitHub, and a third updating docs—all running simultaneously.
 * A new, upgraded Plan Mode: Claude now builds more precise plans and 
executes more thoroughly. It asks clarifying questions upfront, uses subagents 
to explore your codebase, and builds a user-editable plan.md file to document 
its plan before executing.
More new features for Claude:

 * Claude for Chrome now works right in your browser—summarizing pages, 
filling forms, and handling busywork. Now available to all Max plan users in 
beta.Add to Chrome <http://claude.ai/chrome>.
 * Claude for Excel lets you work with Claude directly in your spreadsheets, 
now with support for pivot tables, charts, file uploads, and a shortcut to open 
the Claude add-in. Installthe add-in <https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel>
—now in beta.
To give you room to try out our new model, we’re also updating rate limits for 
Max users:

 * Your Sonnet usage stays exactly the same. You’ll notice a new 
Sonnet-specific limit in your settings. It’s set to match your previous overall 
limit, so you can use just as much Sonnet as before.
 * What's new is more headroom for Opus. We’ve removed the Opus-specific cap 
so you can use Opus 4.5 up to your overall limit. We’ve also increased overall 
limits so that you now get roughly the same number of Opus tokens as you 
previously got Sonnet tokens. That's a significant upgrade in model capability 
for your daily work.
We’ve increased usage limits to make sure you’re able to use Opus 4.5 while it 
remains our leading model. As future models surpass it, we expect to update 
limits accordingly—adjusting rate limits down to a steady-state level as usage 
patterns evolve.
