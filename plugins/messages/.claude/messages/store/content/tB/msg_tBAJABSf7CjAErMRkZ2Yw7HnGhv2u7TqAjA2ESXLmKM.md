Hey there,

To speed up system fixes and enhancements, we've implemented a dedicated monthly
maintenance window.
 * When: The second Saturday of each month (December 13, 2025)
 * Time: 9 am to 10 am EST
 * Impact: Downtime is expected to be 10 minutes or less, but please prepare for
   a possible outage of up to an hour.


No action is required from you at this time. We simply ask that you are aware of
this new scheduled window and prepare your trading systems for the possibility
of a brief monthly downtime.

We are committed to continuous improvement, and this process change will help us
deliver stability and enhancements with greater speed.

If you have any questions or require further clarification, please reach out to
our support team at support@alpaca.markets [support@alpaca.markets].

Sincerely,
The Alpaca Team
