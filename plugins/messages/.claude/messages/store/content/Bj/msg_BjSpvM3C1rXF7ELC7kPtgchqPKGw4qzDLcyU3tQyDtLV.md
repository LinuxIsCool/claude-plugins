<html>Are you aware of split spread orders, which are orders that are priced within the spread between the bid price and ask price? These orders yield significant price improvement when they fill, and may earn you exchange rebates for adding liquidity. <br />IBKR lets you easily submit split spread orders. See how you could be capturing better prices using <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/relative-price-tools.php">split spread</a> orders. <br /></html>
