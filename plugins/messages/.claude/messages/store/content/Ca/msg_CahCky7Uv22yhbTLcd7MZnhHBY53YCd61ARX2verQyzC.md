Hi Shawn,


Across the province, Leader Emily Lowan&rsquo;s tour is shaking up the status quo, showing establishment parties that the BC Greens are building real momentum. 


We officially have more members than the BC Conservatives, and we can grow bigger than the BC NDP, but not without your help.


From Prince George to Golden, Emily and the team have connected with hundreds of BC Greens, both new and longtime supporters. Through these meetings, one thing has become clear: BC is ready for change.


In Penticton, the community gathered at Tin Whistle Brewing to discuss the crises they&rsquo;re facing, from billionaires exploiting the climate crisis to housing prices forcing their neighbours onto the streets. In Kelowna, Emily met with the growing contingent of Young BC Greens to strategize on seizing power from corporations and the 1%. 


The truth is simple: the ultra-wealthy have looted our province. But working people across BC are fighting back, and the BC Greens are standing with them.

Shawn, we need your support to keep building our party and our movement. 


Every donation counts.

Whether it&rsquo;s $5, $50, or $500 , your support directly fuels Emily and the BC Greens&rsquo; mission to claw back public wealth from oligarchs and build an economy that works for the working class.
