Hi Darren,
Yes, it was such a wonderful and powerful gathering of visionaries and
architects/developers!!!
I'm about to send an update to the group, including re: a week of strategic
meetings I just had in Aspen.
BTW - we're likely going to curate and host a special gathering for
investors, etc., in Aspen in February and are going to invite a very select
few of our colleagues to join for that - would you and Shaw potentially be
interested in joining? (And, heck, we could even get some skiing or
snowshoeing in together while you're out here!)...
Also, thank you so much for the updates on the project - - - could you and
I meet soon to review?
Is there anything further we need to figure out / "trouble-shoot" to get it
up and running on the YOE site (and/or linked from the YOE site)?
Many thanks ~ super excited about ALL of this!!!
~A
