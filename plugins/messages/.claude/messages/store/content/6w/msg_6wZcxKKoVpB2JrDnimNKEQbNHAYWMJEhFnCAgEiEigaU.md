skip the previous flight segment, subsequent segments will be canceled, and you
may not be able to change your flight or apply for a refund. Please ensure you
travel in the order of flight segments on your ticket.

3.Please ensure that your identification documents are valid during your trip
and have a validity period of at least 6 months from the end of your travel to
avoid being denied boarding or entry due to issues with your passport,
identification documents, visa, or vaccination records.

4.Flight departure/arrival times are in local time. We recommend arriving at the
airport at least 3 hour(s) before your flight’s departure to ensure you have
sufficient time for check-in procedures.
