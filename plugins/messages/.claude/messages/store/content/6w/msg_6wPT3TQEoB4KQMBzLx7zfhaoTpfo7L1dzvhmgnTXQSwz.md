 Circle partners’ clients have continued to be targeted by individuals posing 
as legitimate web design professionals, typically offering what are described 
as critical website updates for a fee. In many of these cases, the scammers 
have impersonated a professional web designer that the targeted customer had 
worked with previously.

UPDATE: Several customers have also reported that these bad actors used Upwork 
to send payment links. If you see a suspicious-looking message with an Upwork 
link included, please report the incident usingUpwork’s reporting channels 
<https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/35088316534035-Report-suspicious-activity-and-maintain-a-safe-community>
.

There are at least a few variations on the phishing email, but they tend to 
state that Squarespace is making changes that necessitate additional work on 
the part of the web designer in exchange for a fee. You can view an example of 
these phishing emails on theSquarespace Forum 
<https://forum.squarespace.com/topic/342976-ongoing-phishing-attempt-targeting-circle-partner-clients/>
.

Here are some steps you can take now to identify cybersecurity attacks like 
phishing scams and safeguard data:

 * Review and apply security best practices

 andtwo-factor authentication (2FA) 
<https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000044827-Protect-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication>

<https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/35088316534035-Report-suspicious-activity-and-maintain-a-safe-community>

in your previous emails with them.  Thank you, as always, for using Squarespace.
