Hi Shawn,

This week we launched
Exa 2.1 ( https://exa.ai/blog/exa-api-2-1 ) — our latest upgrade to the Exa Search API, built for both state-of-the-art agentic search and ultra-low-latency lookups.

Exa Deep - highest quality agentic search

Exa Deep is now the best option for most use cases on Exa. From complex searches over companies, people, coding docs and any web data for your agents, it is first-in-class across all internal and external benchmarks.

Exa Deep is now available in both our

API

and

MCP server:

* API playground:

https://dashboard.exa.ai/playground/search

* MCP:
https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server/

Exa Fast - sub-500ms search, built from scratch.

Exa Fast

is our low-latency mode for when every millisecond matters. Because Exa runs on a search engine built from scratch (not a SERP wrapper), Exa Fast can consistently return highly relevant results in

<500ms,
compared to the ~1000ms typically seen for proxy APIs.

Use Exa Fast when you need snappy search powering real-time chat or voice agents.

Try Exa 2.1

You can try both Exa Fast and Exa Deep in the Exa dashboard today:

We’re excited to see what you build with it.

Happy searching,

The Exa Team
