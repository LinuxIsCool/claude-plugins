Shawn,

This morning, Prime Minister Mark Carney signed a sweeping energy agreement with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith&mdash;an MOU that lays the groundwork for a brand-new oil pipeline to BC&rsquo;s north coast and even opens the door to weakening the federal tanker ban.

Let&rsquo;s be very clear about what this means:
The federal government and Alberta are negotiating the future of our coast&mdash;without BC, and without Coastal First Nations.

In a 
https://click.email.bcgreens.com/?qs=86127d8d43b2dde638a7c44969ced7475367e4067c5a98e71406ba756274021945b50c1e0ce24c13fc354ab1218bf7e793a08c2c9eea59ca 
statement just yesterday, Coastal First Nations could not have been more unequivocal: &ldquo;This pipeline will never happen.&rdquo; They condemned Ottawa&rsquo;s &ldquo;wall of silence&rdquo; and reminded the federal government (again) that no agreement can override inherent Indigenous rights, title, or the deep responsibilities First Nations hold for the ocean.

We stand firmly with them, and with every Nation along the coast who has been shut out of these discussions.
What&rsquo;s happening:
The Carney&ndash;Smith deal signals a political &ldquo;reset&rdquo; between the federal and Alberta governments, but at BC&rsquo;s expense. The MOU explicitly states that if a future bitumen pipeline is approved by the Major Projects Office, Ottawa will consider adjustments to the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act.

That means exemptions.

That means tankers in the Hecate Strait.

That means the most dangerous waters on the coast&mdash;10-20 metre tides, shifting sandbars, extreme currents&mdash;could face the catastrophic risks of bitumen transport.

Elizabeth May and the federal Greens have already sounded the alarm:

&ldquo;There is no chance on God&rsquo;s green Earth that an oil tanker will ever move through the inner waters between Haida Gwaii and the north coast of British Columbia. None.&rdquo;

We agree.
What you can do right now:

Tell your MP: No backroom pipeline deal. No tanker ban exemptions. Not in BC.

Email or call your MP today and tell them:

	- 
You oppose any attempt to carve out exceptions to Canada&rsquo;s tanker ban.

	- 
You reject Ottawa negotiating pipeline pathways without First Nations or BC at the table.

	- 
You expect your MP to publicly oppose any new pipeline proposal to the north coast.

2.

Contact Premier David Eby  &mdash; and demand an unequivocal stance.

The Premier has said a pipeline like this is &ldquo;unacceptable.&rdquo; Now we need him to prove it.

Tell Eby to:

	- 
Publicly and forcefully reject this pipeline proposal.

	- 
Demand full, government-to-government engagement with Coastal First Nations before any discussions continue.

	- 
Stand up to Ottawa and oppose tanker ban exemptions outright.

3.

Stand with Coastal First Nations  &mdash; amplify their leadership

Share their statement on social media, talk about it with your networks, and help ensure their position reaches every corner of the province.

Public legitimacy lies with Coastal First Nations&mdash;not with deals negotiated in private.
4. Contact key federal ministers

Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 


Use a clear subject line like &ldquo;Urgent: Oppose tanker-ban exemption & Northern BC pipeline&rdquo; and tell them that:

	- 

This proposal flouts the rights of Coastal First Nations and violates the spirit of UNDRIP and free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC).

	- 

The Oil Tanker Moratorium exists for a reason&mdash;to protect BC&rsquo;s most dangerous waters and our coastal communities from catastrophic risk.

	- 
BC communities will not be collateral damage in a federal&ndash;Alberta political deal.

	- 

Any attempt to carve out exemptions or weaken the tanker ban will face widespread opposition and legal scrutiny.


Even a small wave of messages can shift internal conversations and force accountability. If enough supporters speak up, federal ministers will have to take notice&mdash;and act to defend our coast.
Our commitment:
The BC Greens will use every tool available to challenge this reckless plan. 

We will continue to work in full solidarity with Coastal First Nations. We will stand alongside Elizabeth May and the federal Greens in defending our coastline and rejecting any attempt to weaken the tanker ban.

And we will be crystal clear with both Ottawa and Victoria: This pipeline will not proceed. Not here. Not ever.

Thank you for being part of a movement that refuses to look away when our coast, our climate, and Indigenous rights are on the line.


With determination,

Your BC Greens team
