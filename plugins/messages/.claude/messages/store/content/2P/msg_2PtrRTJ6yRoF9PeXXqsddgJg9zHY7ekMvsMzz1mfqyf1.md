Claude and Claude Code subscriptions are now giftable. Here’s how some of our 
power users unlock serious productivity. 







Share Claude with someone you love 




 <https://www.claude.ai/gift> 


This holiday season, you can give Claude or Claude Code to your friends and 
family.

Claude Pro or Max makes a great gift for the thinkers, problem solvers, and 
creatives in your life. So give them a collaborator that writes, analyzes, 
supports work deliverables, and thinks through complex problems with them. If 
an AI that builds features, fixes bugs, and ships code alongside them is more 
their speed, Claude Code is now giftable, too.

Choose a plan, pick a subscription length (from 1 month to 1 year), and send 
it their way. No credit card required to redeem. Just a gift they’ll actually 
use.

PS: Already have a Claude fan in your life? Surprise them by extending their 
current subscription with one of these gifts.
