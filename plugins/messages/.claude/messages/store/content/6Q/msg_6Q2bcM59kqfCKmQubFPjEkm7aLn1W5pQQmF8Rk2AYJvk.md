** Last Chance to Grab Cascadia Gear for the Holidays
------------------------------------------------------------

Hello wonderful Cascadians,

We just wanted to let people know that the USPS deadline for US based holiday ordering is tomorrow, Wednesday December 17th for guaranteed delivery.

While we will keep packing and sending up until next week, as fast as we are able, please keep in mind we need time to pack and get orders to the post office. So, if you’re wanting any stickers, patches, flags, shirts etc for the holiday season, please get orders in as soon as possible.

Grab items & gear here:
