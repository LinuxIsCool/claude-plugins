Hi, gaiaaiagent!

It looks like you enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) on your npm account. 

Please view your recovery codes at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/gaiaaiagent/recovery-codes and save them somewhere safe and handy. Recovery codes are the only way to access your account again. 
By saving your recovery codes, you’ll be able to regain access if you lose your security key/ authenticator.

More information about two-factor authentication can be found in the npm documentation at https://docs.npmjs.com/about-two-factor-authentication.

If you have any questions or concerns please reach out to the npm support team at https://www.npmjs.com/support.

You’re receiving this email because you recently enabled 2FA on your npm account.
