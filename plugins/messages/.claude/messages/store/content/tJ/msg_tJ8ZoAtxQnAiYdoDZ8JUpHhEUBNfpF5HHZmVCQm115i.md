Dear Client,
We are excited to announce that clients can earn commission credits by completing Traders’ Academy courses in Portal. To get started, log in to Portal ( https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login?RL=1&locale=en_US ) and select Education > Learn & Earn.

You can earn USD 100 in commission credits for each of the three eligible Learn & Earn courses. The courses cover Options, Futures and Bonds. Awarded commissions are offered upon completion of ALL course material within the Award Bundle if you have not traded that product for the 180-days prior to completing the course.
Please note that only one account per household can claim the commission credit.
The credits will expire after 180 days if they are not used. In addition, the credits will only be used on the commissions charged by IBKR, not regulatory/third-party fees charged by exchanges.
For additional details on the IBKR Learn & Earn Program, please review the Terms and Conditions ( https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/servlet/Registration_v2.formSampleView?formdb=4363 ).
