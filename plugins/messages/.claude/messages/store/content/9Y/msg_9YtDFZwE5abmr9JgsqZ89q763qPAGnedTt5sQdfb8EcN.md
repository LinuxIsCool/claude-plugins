Dear Endangered Ecosystems Alliance (EEA) Friend,

We’ve launched our Year-End Fundraising Drive to raise $80,000 for 2026 by December 31st!

So far, we have raised over $19,000 to help protect endangered ecosystems across Canada thanks to our generous supporters.

Can you make a holiday-season contribution today to help close the gap? Donations are tax-deductible, can also be made via stocks and securities (see details in the donate link), and are most effective via the monthly donation form (but we are most grateful for all support!).
DONATE TODAY ❤️ (https://www.endangeredecosystemsalliance.org/donation?utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=1ce3f68d7f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_11_03_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-1ce3f68d7f-446069664)

See our “progress thermometer (https://www.endangeredecosystemsalliance.org/news/2025/year-end-fundraising?utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=1ce3f68d7f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_11_03_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-1ce3f68d7f-446069664) ” on how much we have raised so far (and help recruit friends, family and associates to also donate).


** What is the Endangered Ecosystems Alliance (EEA) currently working on?
------------------------------------------------------------

At the federal level, we’re pushing for strong protected areas legislation - specifically, a reintroduction and strengthening of the Nature Accountability Bill (https://www.endangeredecosystemsalliance.org/news/natureaccountability2025?utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=1ce3f68d7f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_11_03_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-1ce3f68d7f-446069664) (which died on the order paper when the previous federal election was called). This bill would require this government and all future governments to meet Canada’s international protected areas commitment, including protecting 30% of our lands and waters by 2030. This is a vital piece of legislation that would supercharge the expansion of nature protection across Canada.

However, the 2025 federal budget made no commitment (https://www.endangeredecosystemsalliance.org/news/2025federalbudget?utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=1ce3f68d7f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_11_03_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-1ce3f68d7f-446069664) to fund the expansion of nature protection in Canada (funding needed for private land acquisition or to support First Nations protected areas initiatives). Existing federal funding runs out this spring, so we are working hard to secure the necessary new allocation of funds.

In British Columbia, we’re working intensively to protect old-growth forests and endangered ecosystems by:
* Pushing for a BC Protected Areas Strategy (PAS), so the province actively pursues protection for the highest conservation value areas rather than waiting on the sidelines;
* Advancing ecosystem-based protection targets - a kind of “GPS for protected areas creation” that directs protection toward the most endangered ecosystems - through the proposed Biodiversity and Ecosystem Health (BEH) Framework, which the province has been dragging its heels on;
* Supporting “Solutions Space” funding for First Nations, so they can undertake old-growth logging deferrals without losing their major source of revenue.

Check out one of our more popular old-growth video clips HERE (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp3iL72wy4A&utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=1ce3f68d7f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_11_03_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-1ce3f68d7f-446069664)  and our recent media release on BC Old-Growth policies HERE (https://www.endangeredecosystemsalliance.org/news/2025/09/11/media-release-five-years-after-old-growth-strategic-review-bc-government-stalls-progress?utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=1ce3f68d7f-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_11_03_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-1ce3f68d7f-446069664 ) .

We continue to work overtime with First Nations communities to help establish new Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (IPCAs) in some of the most endangered old-growth forests in BC. This is some of the most involved work we have ever undertaken, and indispensable to getting protected areas established on the ground. We will have more news on several of these complex initiatives in the near future.

Looking ahead, we will be working on:
* Helping protect grasslands on the Prairies;
* Helping halt open-pit coal mining in Alberta;
* Helping new protected areas in the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence region;
* Launching a mass public education campaign on the health and economic benefits of nature protection.

...and that’s just the start, there's a lot more to come!

Over the years, thousands of our supporters like you have played a pivotal role in helping us:
* Get the BC government to commit to Canada’s 30% by 2030 protection target;
* Successfully push the BC government to secure $1.2 billion in federal–provincial funding to expand protected areas, including in old-growth forests, via the BC Nature Agreement and the BC Conservation Financing Mechanism;
* Helped to get the previous federal administration to develop and introduce the Nature Accountability Bill last year;
* Help to successfully move forward the establishment of the South Okanagan–Similkameen National Park Reserve;
* Help local groups in Alberta to thwart the dismantling of over 170 Alberta parks and recreation areas; and
* Successfully helped to push the Ontario government via mass social media campaigns to reverse its removal of the Ontario Greenbelt.

...and more!

Many of these are big, structural wins for nature, and you’ve been a vital part of them. We are a highly effective organization that punches far above our weight in landing results, due to several important factors, including our:
* Extensive experience (our core team has campaigned for many decades to protect nature).
* Depth of science, policy and campaigning insights (via our extensive experience, education, and an organizational culture of rigorous research and constant learning).
* Large-scale outreach and education campaigns via social and news media campaigns that reach millions of Canadians (we are not here to play small).
* Unique approach that prioritizes protecting the most at-risk ecosystems, engaging non-traditional allies, undertaking conservation financing to support Indigenous Protected Areas, raising and working on the issues that most concern most people - the economy and health, as it relates to nature, and saying “thank you” to give credit where credit is due, including to governments when they deliver on key policies, while criticizing when we need to criticize.

…and more!
