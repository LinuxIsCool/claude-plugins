Dear Shawn,

**What does it take to build a mission-driven company, scale it and exit on your terms?**

Few founders can answer that as clearly (or as honestly) as Nejeed Kassam https://techexit.io/speaker/najeed-kassam-vancouver/?utm_campaign=tx-van-speaker-spotlight-nejeed-kassam&utm_source=email&utm_medium=profile-cta.

As the 

**Founder & former CEO of Keela**, Nejeed led one of Canada’s standout impact-tech exits in 2023.

Today, he’s building again as the 

**CEO & Co-Founder of Rewire Digital Therapeutics** and 

**Co-Founder of Useful Tech**, bringing fresh insight from both the startup trenches and the deal table.

With experience spanning entrepreneurship, public policy, global innovation and leadership through acquisition, Nejeed brings a perspective that founders rarely get access to (and absolutely need).

At TechExit.io Vancouver 2026 https://techexit.io/vancouver/?utm_campaign=tx-van-speaker-spotlight-nejeed-kassam&utm_source=email&utm_medium=homepage-cta, he’ll share:

* How to scale with purpose 

**and** optionality

* Lessons learned from leading an impact company through acquisition

* What founders overlook when preparing for the deal

* How to build again after the exit

**This is the kind of speaker who changes how you think about building and selling.**
