Hi Shawn, thanks for sharing! Your demo sparked a bunch of questions for
me. I'm about to start a project for a non-profit in the climate space that
I think will have a similar architecture (very different problem domain) to
what you're building. Maybe we can knowledge share and I can help you
iterate on the format of your storymap if you'd be willing to do a
technical walkthrough of what you demoed today.

My schedule is pretty open the rest of this week and next week.

Thanks,
Zach
