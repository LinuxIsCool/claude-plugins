Before we step into a new chapter, we’re taking a moment to look back at the events we powered, the partnerships we forged, and the milestones that shaped Moongate’s journey throughout the year.

----------
## **We’re now a part of Humanity Protocol**

A defining moment this year was Moongate officially becoming part of the Humanity Protocol family. This milestone brought on-chain tickets to Humanity’s Human IDs for the first time.

## **Events That Came to Life**

**ETHDenver 2025**
We powered ticketing for 21,000+ attendees across 60+ countries, delivering a custom solution that embedded ticketing directly into ETHDenver accounts. This seamless integration encouraged adoption of the new ETHDenver wallet, enabling attendees to receive and stake $SPORK while experiencing a unified, all-in-one event platform.

**Avalanche Summit**
Hosted in a Royal Family estate in London, the 2025 Summit blended tradition with tech. Moongate powered the full white label ticketing flow with Avalanche minted tickets, AVAX payments, and real time attendee management.

**TOKEN2049 Dubai & Singapore**
For the second year, Moongate powered the gamified attendee web app, now extending engagement before the event. With Moongate’s upcoming AI verifier for social interactions, thousands of attendees earned more points than ever before. Participation in the official side quest grew by more than 50 percent, with popular activities such as cold plunges, padel, and climbing walls.

**Moongate by Humanity at KBW**
This year, we showcased the power of Moongate by Humanity at KBW, where we demonstrated palm-based event entry in action. It was a defining moment in showing how simple, secure, and modern event access can be.

**Origin Summit by Story Protocol at KBW**
We supported the inaugural gathering focused on the future of IP as a programmable, legally enforceable asset. Key discussions explored AI-driven creative economies, cross-border innovation in Southeast Asia, and the rising importance of sovereign digital solutions built on open standards.

**Event Outlook**
Attendance in 2025 remained strong and new project-led summits continued to emerge. Consensus made a successful debut in Hong Kong, and Gate’s Token of Love music festival, held twice this year, is quickly becoming a major Web2 event with Web3 utility supporting it behind the scenes.

----------
## **Partnership Highlight**


----------**Binance **
This year we completed our global partnership powering all Binance events. We streamlined event creation for 30 plus regional teams with unified branding, custom presets, localized access, Binance login, a white label discovery page, and BNB Chain integration, including BNB payments through Binance Pay for Blockchain Week.

----------
## **Here’s to many more milestones in 2026**
