Hi Shawn,

I wanted to personally invite you to something I'm hosting next week.

2025 was a strange year for me. I raised my own venture round. I launched a fund. I started making introductions that used to require decades of relationships or knowing someone who went to Stanford.

And now, heading into 2026, I keep hearing the same question: "What does this mean for how the game works now?"

So I'm sitting down with my co-founder Andrew D'Souza and Sarah Lacy for a year-end conversation — and I'd love for you to join us.

We'll get into:
* Why "who your uncle is" still determines which meetings get taken — and what breaks when that's no longer true
* The fund-returning company sitting in someone's inbox right now, growing cold
* What it actually takes for "everyone has a company in them" to be true
* Why this company couldn't have been built in Silicon Valley
* The strange experience of building something autonomous — and learning to let go

📅 Wednesday, December 17th
⏰ 12PM EST / 9AM PST
📍 Virtual (Zoom)

This isn't a product demo. It's a real conversation about access, trust, and what's shifting. A good one to sit with before the holidays.

I hope you can make it.
