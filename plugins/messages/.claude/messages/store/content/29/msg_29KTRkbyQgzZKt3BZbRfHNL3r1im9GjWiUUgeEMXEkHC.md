Can't decide whether to fly or sail between Vancouver Island and the mainland? Why not both!

Hullo has partnered with Seair to bring a unique travel opportunity this winter: starting December 1st, guests can take a seaplane one way and the fast ferry the other way, for just $119 roundtrip.

From the sea to the sky, treat yourself to a new perspective at this discounted rate until January 31, 2026. Contact Seair Nanaimo to book directly.
