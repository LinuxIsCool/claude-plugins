Hi Shawn,

As MLAs, we see it every day in the legislature: British Columbians need stronger voices fighting for them &mdash; and there simply aren&rsquo;t enough of us.

The BC Greens are taking on corporate power, pushing for real affordability solutions, and standing up for climate action with just two seats. We do that work proudly, but we need reinforcements.


Whether a by-election gives Leader Emily Lowan a chance to run next year, or a snap election is called, we need to act now &mdash; building the resources to organize, campaign, and put the 99% first in the halls of power.

This is where we stand today:

We still have significant ground to cover before December 31, Shawn.

A year-end donation 
https://click.email.bcgreens.com/?qs=eb46f62e07dc02797c9d890df43d538aacba36a74b8bc39b0b294ab52f64dc799972074342d3000544274fb7af527ee79148458218f4eebc 
right now  directly supports the work that makes growth possible &mdash; from organizing on the ground to being ready for an election call at a moment&rsquo;s notice. This is how we build a team that can actually challenge corporate interests and deliver for people across BC.

If you&rsquo;re able to give before December 31, your support would make a real difference.

With appreciation and resolve,

Jeremy & Rob
