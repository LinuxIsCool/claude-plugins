Email from Human Impacts Institute Fuel collective action and drive bold climate leadership with us.   Hello Shawn, As we move through Giving Tuesday and into the final month of 2025, I invite you to join us in supporting our Inspire Action, Ignite Change campaign. Our goal is to raise $10,000 by December 31. Every contribution fuels our fellowship programs, climate exhibitions, and community workshops—empowering emerging leaders and uplifting underrepresented voices around the world. Donate today and help spark collective action. In November, we celebrated Indigenous Heritage Month with a powerful conversation between young leaders Lily Joy Winder and Somah Toya Haaland, honoring Indigenous community, identity, and joy. Thank you to all who joined us—your engagement strengthens our mission. We’re thrilled to open submissions for the 2026 Creative Climate Awards, themed Collective Power, inviting artists to show how solidarity and shared vision drive transformative climate action. At a time when global challenges can feel overwhelming, this theme invites artists to illuminate how solidarity and shared vision can spark transformative climate action, and remind us that meaningful change is never the work of one, but of many. Across our work—from the creativity of our Youth Advisory Council to the community-centered initiatives of our Social Amplifiers—we see how collaboration fuels change. We’re excited to highlight stories of YAC leaders in action from empowering indigenous leadership in Peru to advancing sustainable fashion in Guatemala. And also happy to celebrate Social Amplifiers whose projects are creating lasting local impact across NYC. We also hope to see you in NYC on December 7 for our Social Amplifier Concetta Abbate’s event, Music and the Ecology of Cemeteries. And we’re proud to support our Crew Member Jolly Patel, participating in the American Council on Germany’s Social Cohesion program, exploring how U.S. cities are addressing urgent community challenges like education, immigration, and affordable housing. Thank you for being part of this journey. Your support is incredibly important to us and makes real change possible. I am filled with gratitude and inspiration by the incredible work happening across our Human Impacts Institute community. With hope and in action, ﻿Tara DePorte Founder and Executive Director Human Impacts Institute   GIVING TUESDAY: INSPIRE ACTION, IGNITE CHANGE - HELP FUEL OUR WORK Our Giving Season campaign, Inspire Action, Ignite Change, is in full swing as we continue working to push towards our $10,000 goal to raise essential funds for our fellowship programs, including the Urban Environmental Health Lab (UEHL), the Creative Climate Awards (CCA), and our Creative Climate Communications (C3) Lab.

RSVP PROGRAM UPDATES NYC SOCIAL AMPLIFIERS IN ACTION In November, two of our Social Amplifiers, Kenton Archer and Avani Patel, hosted community-centered environmental and conservation initiatives that support people and local ecosystems as part of their Creative Climate Communications Lab project. Shoutout to some of the volunteers pictured! Kenton’s workshop in partnership with Easter Queens Alliance in Queens discussed ways to engage students in service projects that foster leadership and civic responsibility, and explored how science and technology can help identify community needs and opportunities for impact. Updates were shared on ongoing efforts, including tree planting, citizen science projects, and work in the Idlewild Peace Garden. Planning is also underway for the Spring 2026 Idlewild 5K Walk/Run, an inclusive community event designed to promote health and wellness, support local commerce, and strengthen collaboration across neighborhoods. Avani led a local litter clean-up Project in partnership with the Sanitation Foundation and NYC Parks in Brooklyn, focused on gathering local community members to get involved in cleaning up Sunset Park and bring awareness to the issue of growing concerns of littering. Thanks to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservations Community Impact Grant program for supporting this initiative. YOUTH ADVISORY COUNCIL MAKING WAVES HII’s Youth Advisory Council (YAC) members received microgrants to advance environmental projects in their communities. As these initiatives are near completion, we’re excited to share the stories and impacts of their work. This youth-led program empowers emerging climate activists to drive awareness and innovation, made possible by the support of the Earth Rising Foundation. Ecohope: Green Generation (by Célio Monteiro José) - Célio’s project, Green Generation, led by his youth-led non-profit EcoHope in Chimoio, Mozambique, empowers students to become environmental leaders through hands-on learning. The project establishes eco-clubs, trains youth in climate-smart farming, and promotes waste management and “waste-to-art” initiatives. So far, it has engaged over 1,600 students, fostering sustainable practices and environmental awareness within the school community. Protecting the Environment (by Carlos D. Lozano Suarez) - Carlos is leading a powerful project focused on supporting the Kichwa native communities of the Chazuta district in the Lower Huallaga region of Peru. This youth-led initiative uses art as a tool for cultural preservation and social transformation, offering participatory workshops, photography sessions, and intergenerational exchanges to capture stories and traditions at risk of being lost. The project will culminate in a book showcasing the community’s deep connection to nature and vibrant cultural energy, while inspiring more young people to take pride in their roots and protect their heritage. The Revolution Camp (by Carmen Valenzuela) - Carmen’s project provides scholarships to young creatives in Guatemala, enabling them to participate in a program focused on sustainable and circular fashion. Through workshops and mentorship, participants explore new design methodologies, strengthen their skills, and develop socially and environmentally responsible fashion initiatives. The program fosters diversity and collaboration, ensuring that youth can drive positive change in their communities. Clima x Educación x Diplomacia (by Dylan Pereira) - Dylan’s transformative program is developing the next generation of climate leaders across Venezuela and Latin America, connecting education, diplomacy, and community action to address urgent environmental challenges. It emphasizes broad geographic and cultural representation—including Indigenous leaders—and leverages partnerships with media, academic, and specialized organizations to provide training, research support, and communication amplification.  Climate Conversations ft. humour (by Vandita Sariya Vandita) - Vandita uses multimedia to make climate conversations more engaging and accessible, collaborating with the youth-led organization There Is No Earth B (TINEB) to strengthen their advocacy and climate outreach. She creates cartoons, zines, and other creative assets for social media, while sharing communication strategies and resources to help TINEB continue their impactful, youth-driven work in climate and social justice. Yaotzin Fuego Y Territorio (by Courtney Elmes) - Courtney is working with Yaotzin Fuego y Territorio, a Mexico-based organization dedicated to sustainable land management and fire prevention. Following a 2024 fire in El Arenal, the group launched a soil restoration project to control erosion, stabilize the land, and reduce future fire risks, partnering with local volunteers to protect the community and environment. Their work highlights the impact of proactive, community-driven environmental stewardship. EXPLORING SOCIAL COHESION This past September our Crew Member Jolly Patel participated in part one of the American Council on Germany’s Social Cohesion program, which brought together participants from the United States and Germany to meet with German political leaders and civil society organizations who are addressing challenges related to migration, integration and threats to democracy. ﻿Next week the cohort will convene for part two of the study tour where they will spend a week in Philadelphia and Nashville exploring how U.S. cities are tackling key community challenges, including access to education, immigration services, and affordable housing, among other pressing issues. We look forward to sharing key insights from this experience. HOW EVERYDAY VOICES DRIVE BIG CHANGE The Creative Climate Communication Lab (C3) Social Amplifiers Report showcases how everyday individuals and small, well-connected groups can drive meaningful social change by leveraging their networks, spreading ideas, and strategically shifting narratives. Here are some key lessons from the report: Anyone can spark change by understanding their unique position within a network and leveraging it strategically. Social change is rarely driven by heroic figures alone. Often, it begins with ordinary individuals who use their connections and communities to spark broader transformation. Small groups can shift systems. You don’t need vast numbers; A small, determined, and well-connected group with clarity of purpose can trigger major social shifts. Indeed, tight-knit communities which live outside big cities often have a bigger chance to spark change because their connections to each other are stronger. Utilizing our networks and community connections to spread ideas drives long-lasting change. Strong relationships, built on trust, help people adopt and sustain new behaviors. Weak ties carry ideas and information, sometimes acting as bridges by bringing information to a new group. And when the same message shows up in multiple trusted places, it reinforces credibility and creates space for lasting changes. Strategically shifting the narratives around us can expand the boundaries of what feels socially acceptable. Leverage points are places within a complex system where a small shift can change how people understand an issue. By framing ideas in ways that connect with everyday experiences and cultural touchpoints, amplifiers can turn the radical into mainstream. Research can drive impact when it’s translated into practice. This research was used to design a 2-day training pilot in NYC that equips participants with practical skills to recognize their own potential to catalyze change and make meaningful impact in their communities. The pilot demonstrated that research is a critical tool for building those skills. Thanks to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservations Community Impact Grant program for supporting this initiative.
