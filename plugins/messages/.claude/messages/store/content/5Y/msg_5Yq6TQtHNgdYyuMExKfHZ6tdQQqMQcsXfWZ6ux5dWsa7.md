You are receiving this email because your usage of GitHub Actions may be impacted by upcoming changes to GitHub Actions pricing ( https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions ).

*What’s changing, when*

* On *January 1, 2026* , all customers *will receive up to a 39% reduction in the net price of GitHub-hosted runners* , depending on the machine type used.
* On *March 1, 2026* , we are introducing a new $0.002 per-minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge that *will apply to self-hosted runner usage*. Any usage subject to this charge will count toward the minutes included in your plan ( https://docs.github.com/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions#free-use-of-github-actions ).

No action is required on your part.

We’re excited to say that as a whole this means GitHub will be charging less than ever for Actions. 96% of customers will receive a lower bill or see no change.

Please note the price for runner usage in public repositories will remain free, and there will be no changes in price structure for GitHub Enterprise Server customers.

For more details, please visit our posts on GitHub’s Executive Insights page ( https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions ) and the GitHub Changelog ( https://github.blog/changelog/2025-12-16-coming-soon-simpler-pricing-and-a-better-experience-for-github-actions/ ).

*Why we’re making this change*

Actions usage has grown significantly, across both CI/CD and agentic workloads. This update provides lower costs for most Actions users, aligns pricing with actual consumption patterns, and helps us continue investing in improvements to the Actions platform for the benefit of all customers.

*Recommended resources*

To help you prepare for this change, we’ve published several updated tools and guides:

* For answers to common questions about this change, see the FAQ in our post on GitHub’s Executive Insights page ( https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions ).
* See the GitHub Actions runner pricing documentation ( https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing ) for the new GitHub-hosted runner rates effective January 1, 2026.
* For more details on upcoming GitHub Actions releases, see the GitHub public roadmap ( https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247 ).
* For help estimating your expected Actions usage cost, use the newly updated Actions pricing calculator ( https://github.com/pricing/calculator#actions ).
* If you are interested in moving existing self-hosted runner usage to GitHub-hosted runners, see the SHR to GHR migration guide ( http://docs.github.com/actions/tutorials/migrate-to-github-runners ) in our documentation.
