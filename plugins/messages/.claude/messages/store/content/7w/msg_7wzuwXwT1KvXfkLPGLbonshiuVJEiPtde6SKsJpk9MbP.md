Member would otherwise collect, without the bonus. Example: On a $100 (pre-tax)
purchase with a 20X bonus multiplier a Member would earn a bonus $8 in CT Money
(20 X .4% X $100). Not all items sold are eligible to earn CT Money or to be
redeemed for. Conditions apply. Visit triangle.com for full program rules and
Partner location information. The offered rate is exclusive of any bonus or
promotional offers or redemption transactions. CT Money is collected on the
