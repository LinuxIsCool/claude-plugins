Hi Shawn,

Today marks exactly two weeks until our

December 31 deadline .

But before I ask you to give, I want to say thank you.

Over the past months, I&rsquo;ve travelled across British Columbia on my first tour as your leader. Community halls. Union offices. Kitchens. Front steps. Everywhere I went, people showed up, spoke honestly, and trusted me with their stories. I don&rsquo;t take that lightly.

I started my political journey in 2016, when Trump was elected and something snapped into focus for so many of us: no one is coming to save us. That realization pushed me into organizing, first in my school, then my university, then across the country. And when I came home to BC, it was impossible to ignore what so many of you already know in your bones &mdash; things are getting worse.

On this tour, I heard the same story again and again.

In Prince Rupert, working families told me they&rsquo;re going hungry while a 97-year-old billionaire tightens his grip on the fishing industry that once sustained their communities.

In Golden, I met a fire chief whose department is stretched impossibly thin, underpaid and overworked, as wildfire seasons grow longer and more dangerous every year.

In Kamloops, doctors walked away from an entire maternity ward after being pushed into unsafe 80-hour work weeks &mdash; while the government continues pouring public money into privatized health care instead of fixing what&rsquo;s broken.

These are not isolated failures. They&rsquo;re the result of a system that protects massive corporations and oligarchs while abandoning the rest of us to a brutal cost-of-living crisis. Guaranteed, there&rsquo;s an oligarch near you doing the same thing.

But I also saw something else on this tour: hope rooted in action.

In Prince George, union members are fighting to bring forestry under worker control, with renewable practices that protect both jobs and the forests their families depend on.

On Gitxsan territories, the Sik E Dakh community is building and owning their own food systems, energy projects, housing, and childcare. Not as a thought experiment &mdash; but right now, in British Columbia.

These communities prove that the status quo isn&rsquo;t inevitable. That a different economy is possible if government has the courage to support working people instead of catering to the 1%.

That&rsquo;s what the BC Greens are here to do. Not tinker around the edges. Not politely ask billionaires to behave better. But build real grassroots power, propose real solutions, and fight for a province that works for people &mdash; not corporate interests.

So this tour might be ending, but our movement is just beginning!

And with just

two weeks left  before our 2025 fundraising deadline, I&rsquo;m asking you to help fund the next phase of this work: organizing in communities, growing our movement, and preparing for the fights ahead in 2026.

If you can donate $8, $10, or whatever you&rsquo;re able to give today, it will make a real difference. If you&rsquo;ve already given, thank you &mdash; truly. If you&rsquo;ve been waiting, this is the moment.
