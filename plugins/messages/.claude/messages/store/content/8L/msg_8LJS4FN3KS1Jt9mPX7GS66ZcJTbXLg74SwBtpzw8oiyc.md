As the community around this newsletter continues to grow, we will keep you updated on “Early Access success stories” when they happen. 

Also: if you have some time over the holidays this week, tomorrow we’re releasing the final episode of Season Two of our [Coeus Collective Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsdYh_ZNuqRtidSCsA-d7TuI-X92LD1gv) (available on YouTube and all podcast platforms), featuring NFL agent David Canter, who has negotiated over $2B of deals in his career.

You wake up to 58 emails, 15 messages, and a dozen Slack pings: and it’s not even 9 am. We’re sure this sounds unfortunately familiar to many of you. Today’s digital age requires us to constantly be “on,” navigating countless apps and constantly losing focus. Even with hours a day sifting through messages, important emails are still overlooked, leading to costly missed opportunities.

This is why co-founders Cristina Grau Vílchez and Mathieu Bertrandy have created Twintual: the single AI interface for messaging. Twintual consolidates all your inboxes (email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Slack, etc.) into one platform, earning you back hours every day and allowing you to focus on what matters most.

The app filters out spam, marketing, and other unwanted messages, only showing summaries of the most important notifications. After assessing which messages require a response, Twintual can then draft a reply in the same language as the message received while keeping summaries and system features in your chosen language. 

Everyone’s Twintual is unique; the model is trained using a behavioral AI model that learns from your past history and communication style, drafting replies that sound exactly like you. There are settings to control the level of autonomy, such as whether Twintual can directly send replies or only create drafts for you to review. Beyond messaging, your digital twin can summarize conversations, unify your calendar, and let you assign tasks – ultimately simplifying digital chaos.

### But what can you actually DO about the proclaimed ‘AI bubble’? Billionaires know an alternative…

_Sure_, if you held your stocks since the dotcom bubble, you would’ve been up—eventually. But three years after the dot-com bust the S&P 500 was still far down from its peak. So, how else can you invest when almost every market is tied to stocks?

Lo and behold, billionaires have an alternative way to diversify: allocate to a physical asset class that outpaced the S&P by 15% from 1995 to 2025, _with almost no correlation to equities_. It’s part of a massive global market, long leveraged by the ultra-wealthy (Bezos, Gates, Rockefellers etc).

Contemporary and post-war art.

Over 70,000 members have together invested more than $1.2 billion across over 500 artworks. So far, 23 sales have delivered net annualized returns like 17.6%, 17.8%, and 21.5%.*

AI adoption in business communication has accelerated rapidly as companies look for ways to manage rising message volume and reduce inefficiencies. Tools like Superhuman, Slack AI, and Gmail Smart Reply have improved email productivity, but they only address one channel at a time. No solution has successfully solved the root problem: professionals are overwhelmed not only by messages, but also by the number of platforms they must constantly toggle between. Twintual’s app consolidates productivity and implements behavioral AI that acts on behalf of the user to address this gap.

Over the past year, the team completed market research with more than 400 prospective customers, iterated on its MVP through multiple product cycles, and integrated key features such as unified inboxing and multilingual response generation. The company has won several awards and was featured in _Forbes_, which helped drive early interest and visibility.

Following the private launch of their MVP in September, Twintual onboarded 80+ paying customers and received **95% positive feedback in user testing**. Early adopters reported significant time savings, with most users **gaining 1–2 hours back per day**. The team is now preparing to onboard multiple B2B clients in January with a focus on SMEs in their initial go-to-market.

Looking ahead to their **public launch in early 2026**, Twintual has already generated strong demand and will continue to grow their customer base. While the product is industry-agnostic, the team has seen particularly high traction in the hospitality sector.

Cristina completed her **master’s thesis at MIT** on Social Robotics, Data Science, and AI. While at MIT, she conducted LLM research as a Graduate Research Assistant at MIT Media Lab.

Mathieu has several years of experience in computer science and business operations, holding a **Master’s degree in Information Technology from EPITECH**. He is also a Founding Partner at Two.Zero, an innovation agency in Barcelona.

Twintual’s product is based off a well-targeted market insight that addresses a costly pain point in the business world. The team’s background in behavioral AI gives them an edge over other AI assistant startups at this stage, as they have the proven capability to create a functioning personalized model. For both startup founders and enterprise executives, Twintual’s ability to draft replies, summarize threads, and flag important items across channels could unlock serious productivity gains. And with the flexibility to dial up or down its autonomy, the user maintains a satisfying level of customization.

Twintual carries with it the innate risks associated with AI assistants, mainly accuracy and security. We can’t help but wonder if users will feel comfortable giving an AI agent access to their most sensitive conversations and have confidence in Twintual’s ability to replicate their written tone in ambiguous or nuanced conversations. 

Nevertheless, Twintual’s value proposition will certainly be attractive to enterprises large and small, and their growth is likely given already successful traction. After all, we’re all looking to save time in our work lives.

Twintual is currently raising a **$1M pre-seed round in SAFE notes with an $8M post-money valuation**, with 50% already committed. 

The team plans to close the round by year-end and has been prioritizing strategic angel investors, while remaining open to VC participation if the firm has a strong alignment and meaningful value-add.
