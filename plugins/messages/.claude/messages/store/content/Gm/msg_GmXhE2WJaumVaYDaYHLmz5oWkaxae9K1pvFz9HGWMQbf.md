Shawn,

Giving Tuesday is tomorrow &mdash; and we&rsquo;re on the edge of a moment that could reshape the future of the BC Greens.

Last month, something remarkable happened in New York politics. Zohran Mamdani&rsquo;s transition fundraising drew over 12,000 individual donors in under ten days. 

Average gift: $77. People coming together &mdash; small amounts, big impact. The result? Over $1 million raised, powering hiring, organizing, vetting, and policy work before he even takes office.

That&rsquo;s what people-powered politics looks like, Shawn.

And here&rsquo;s the part that matters most: We can do this too.

https://click.email.bcgreens.com/?qs=fb915f7bb4c0fc5164dcdae8b497844f2279d1da6f3af4bc24860dc4106a873e748479b35533619885b4efaf791ebe8b80dea2f6d1066265 
If every one of our members chipped in around $70 , (modeled on Mamdani&rsquo;s average donor) we&rsquo;d raiseover $600,000 &mdash; enough to help us blow past our 2025 fundraising targets and build the infrastructure we need right now to elect Leader Emily Lowan and recruit star candidates across the province.

This is our transition phase.

This is the moment to show that a movement of individuals &mdash; not corporations, not oligarch donors &mdash; can change the course of BC politics.

Shawn, can you make a $70 contribution right now to prove what people-powered politics can do?

Your BC Greens team
