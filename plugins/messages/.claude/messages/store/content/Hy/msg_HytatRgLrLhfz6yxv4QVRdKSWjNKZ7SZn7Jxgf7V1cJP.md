Happy Monday and welcome back to Early Access by Coeus Collective: **the newsletter where we do the sourcing and you get the deal.** **[Last week, we featured Twintual](https://coeuscollective.beehiiv.com/p/early-access-twintual): an AI-powered messaging interface founded by an MIT LLM researcher. In the spirit of a Thanksgiving feast, though, this week we’re taking you back off the screen and onto the table.

Have you ever dreamed of a protein-packed pizza? Well, the future is now. Let’s get to Loopini.

The average pizza is a nutrition nightmare, pushing countless health-conscious consumers away from the beloved comfort food. If you’re on a “cut” or even in “bulking season,” you’d never choose to have a pizza because of its lack of nutritional value in either scenario. Loopini aims to change this by delivering an authentic Italian experience that is packed with protein and other healthy macros.

Loopini is an organic frozen pizza designed to make a high-protein meal accessible and effortless. Their Classic Margherita pizza counts **50g of protein, 20g of fiber, and only 560 total calories**, far outperforming other competitors in nutritional value. Not only is this pizza incredibly healthy, but it is made with restaurant-quality ingredients, earning glowing customer reviews from purchasers at trendy stores like Pop Up Grocer. Their current product line includes Classic Margherita, Truffle, and Vegan Margherita.

# **Now back to Loopini!**

Driven by a growing national focus on weight management and nutrition (exacerbated by the rise of GLP-1 drugs and increasing health awareness), consumers are actively seeking fast, low-commitment, healthy meal options. **The U.S. frozen pizza market alone was valued at $6.62 billion in 2022** and is expected to grow significantly.

Loopini has a unique value proposition within this market because it is at the intersection of convenience and health. Perfect for our age of instant gratification, Loopini bypasses the extensive time and preparation typically associated with healthy food, offering a compelling solution for the modern, health-focused individual.

Their secret? **The Lupini bean.** This Italian superfood is the primary ingredient in their dough, thriving in drought-prone conditions and requiring 88% less water than traditional ingredients. By partnering with a local Italian manufacturer, Loopini has created a supply chain that can’t be replicated. It is also one that is climate-friendly, which could result in an even stronger positioning proposition for the brand moving forward, as 50% of U.S. consumers have stated they are willing to pay more for climate-friendly food options.

Loopini has several channels designed to maximize their sales footprint. The company started by piloting in New York City and the Midwest to develop product-market-fit and a correct pricing strategy. Today, **Loopini has sold 14,000+ pies** and boasts some remarkable statistics about how their brand has been a game-changer for the frozen pizza category: 60% of their customers did not buy frozen pizza before Loopini, and they are currently selling three times faster than competitor brands in the storefronts that they are currently available in.

In 2026, Loopini will conduct a regional expansion into key retail locations, focusing on growth within **Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Target**. The company has product requests from **7,000 retail locations** and is currently building up its supply chain’s capabilities to meet this demand. Within their first three months of sales in grocery storefronts, Loopini has reduced their cost of goods sold by 37.5% and enabled a mass production scale increase of 20 times their initial capacity. Based off their internal estimates, the company is on track for profitability by 2027.

[Damiano Messineo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damiano-messineo-53354018a/) (CEO) is a serial entrepreneur who has previously started four companies, including one that involved him acquiring a hydropower project in Nepal. A native Italian who was a collegiate soccer player, Damiano is a perfect brand ambassador for his company, which bridges Italian heritage & taste with a market opportunity that is tangential to athletics.

His Co-Founders include [Alessandro Pignataro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-pignataro-332b65189/) (COO) and [Lorenzo Felli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-felli-50339b212/) (CFO).

Loopini’s product is a differentiated offering in the saturated frozen pizza market. The high-protein, high-fiber formulation, combined with an authentic Italian taste, gives Loopini a significant edge over competitors like Against the Grain and Banza Pizza, which fall short when compared to Loopini's superior macros. This differentiation is critical in a space where consumer switching costs are negligible.

Loopini's unique positioning and strong growth in the functional food space make it an attractive acquisition target for large food conglomerates. The frozen pizza category offers clear exit viability, one that has existed since Nestlé’s $3.7B acquisition of Kraft’s frozen pizza business in 2010. 

Despite their strong initial success, there are risks that the Loopini team must address. At $14 per pie, Loopini commands an elevated price presence in the frozen pizza market. So, in our opinion, they must seek to expand the market of consumers of frozen pizza.

To win, they will have to demonstrate why they offer a pizza that is worth the investment, highlighting everything from Italian ingredients & production to superior health macros. 

Despite this challenge, Loopini's premium positioning, strong early traction, and scalable manufacturing foundation provide a promising path toward national expansion and long-term profitability. After all: if Whole Foods & Target see it, then why shouldn’t we?
