Dear Friends ~

It was absolutely wonderful gathering with you about a fortnight ago! Thank
you for making it such a fun, dynamic, and successful strategic working
group session!

I am so excited to share with you that I was in Aspen most of last week for
a variety of strategic meetings and gatherings, including several hosted
and facilities by Joanie (*you ROCK Joanie *~ so excited to be weaving the
web with you like this!). As many of you know, I've been connected to the
Aspen community for 25 years now, and have worked with and for several
projects there as well as have had several investors and board members from
current and previous companies up there... notably, our dear friends Brook
and Rose at Sustainable Settings, the biodynamic mother ship featured in
*Viriditas* are anchors in the community, and Joanie and I were delighted
to visit them one afternoon and to enjoy cigars around the fire in the
gentle snowfall at the foot of Wi Magua, the Sacred Heart of the Mountains
(aka Mt. Sopris)... a magical time to be sure.

Through December we will be working diligently with our legal team getting
our formation and investment documents together, while we also continue
connecting and cultivating conversations with potential mission-driven
investors who are being invited to participate in the early-round
investment opportunity - these are invitation only opportunities for this
early round, especially as the alignment with early / founding capital
stewards is essential to the long term success of the project. If you know
anybody that you think we should chat with, please let me know.

We are also continuing to identify and invite a select number of deeply
aligned people into our various governance and stewardship bodies,
including the *Board of Trustees/Directors, the Stewardship Council, the
Sophia Wisdom & Grandmothers Council, the Visionary Technology Council, and
the Elders Council. *

Please let me know if you have any recommendations on any of this!

I'll be in touch in the next few weeks as we take important steps,
including connecting deeply with nature and fire and silence during this
holiday solstice season.

Also, I want to *encourage EVERYBODY working on the ECOSCENE project to
take Fritjof Capra's CAPRA COURSE* this February. They have a tremendously
generous "sliding scale" cost structure, and we have 10% and 15% discount
codes we can utilize with any of their pricing options. The course involves
a couple of international zoom gatherings and about 10 hours of Fritjof's
course videos that you can watch whenever convenient for you. There is also
an extensive "alumni network" of 4,000+ professionals, educators,
scientists, and executives who have also taken the course over the past
decade. I just completed the course, and am so grateful to have the
opportunity to connect and converse with Fritjof in his elder years - - -
he is indeed one of the towering giants upon whose shoulders we can now
stand! (Please see more info below ~ and *PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TAKE THE
CAPRA COURSE* ~ there is so much foundational and integrated scientific
knowledge and cross-cultural wisdom in his tremendous body of work!).

 Big Love,
Aaron

*ADVANCED SCIENCE FOR SYSTEMS CHANGE MAKING ~ SPECIAL “(FRITJOF) CAPRA
COURSE” DISCOUNT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE Y ON EARTH COMMUNITY ~ ESSENTIAL
EDUCATION FOR ALL OF US!!! *



Dear Friends,

We are blessed by an ever-expanding (and rapidly evolving) wealth of
scientific knowledge and a wide-array of masterfully insightful writing
which altogether provide us a robust foundation upon which we do our
systems change-making work.

Among these, in my opinion, one of the most notable scientists and authors
of the last 50+ years is *Fritjof Capra*, whose work spans quantum physics,
cosmology, biology, ecology, neurology, sociology, economics, technology,
cybernetics, consciousness, and holistic systems science. Capra, the author
of *Tao of Physics* (1975), *The Turning Point* (1982), *The Web of
Life* (1996),
*The Hidden Connections* (2002), *The Systems View of Life* (with Pier
Luigi Luisi, 2014), *Patterns of Connection* (2021), as well as remarkable
books about Leonardo da Vinci (*The Science of Leonardo *(2007) and *Learning
from Leonardo* (2013)), has a compelling video course series that I am
currently taking and thoroughly enjoying.

The ”Capra Course <https://www.capracourse.net/info/>” is a concise
masterclass on some of the most important scientific concepts and
discoveries pertaining to human consciousness, our global situation, and
humanity’s ability to respond to the polycrisis with creativity, capacity,
intelligence, and compassion. I cannot think of a better teacher or more
esteemed subject matter expert than Fritjof Capra when it comes to complex
systems science across a holistic paradigmatic world view.

Now, through a very special arrangement with *Capra Course*, the Y on Earth
Community has a limited number of available discount codes that you can use
on course fees for the Spring 2026 course that begins in February. This is
a limited time opportunity – please be sure to take advantage of it while
you can (including meeting Fritjof via live webinar!). Register here
www.capracourse.net/info using either *YOE15Spring2026 *for a 15% discount
or *YOE10Spring2026* for a 10% discount (there are limited numbers of each,
and they’re available on a first-come-first-served basis).



In the course you’ll experience two live-audience interactions with Mr.
Capra and your fellow students, and will experience 12 weekly video modules
on your own time, whenever convenient. Additionally, you’ll have the option
to connect with other students via study groups, and will be able to
connect with the 4,000+ alumni network after completing the course. The 12
weekly modules include:

·       *Systems Thinking*

·       *The Web of Life*

·       *Order and Complexity in the Living World*

·       *The Systems View of Evolution*

·       *Mind and Consciousness*

·       *Science and Spirituality*

·       *The Systems View of Health*

·       *Life, Mind, and Society*

·       *Life and Leadership in Organizations*

·       *The Ecological Dimension of Life*

·       *Systems Thinking and the State of the World*

·       *Systemic Solutions *

I highly encourage all of our community to take this course, and am
delighted to share that Capra and his team have made it available at
several different price points so that it’s broadly accessible. (You are
welcome to use the discount codes on any of the price-points, just select
the one that best fits your situation).

Fritjof Capra is one of my personal heroes, and is, I believe, one of the
most important thinkers and teachers of our time – he is, IMHO, an
essential teacher for those of us working toward planetary prosperity,
stewardship, regeneration, and sustainability.

If you consider yourself an effective or aspiring change-maker, community
leader, planetary steward, and/or sophisticated executive, entrepreneur,
investor, or philanthropist, I* implore* you to take his Capra Course,
starting in February, and to sign up asap to take advantage of the special
discount pricing available exclusively to our Y on Earth Community!

Again, here’s the link to register: www.capracourse.net/info

Looking forward,

Aaron
