We’ve changed how we calculate tax on your purchases.



 <https://claude.ai>



We are writing to let you know about some changes to how we calculate and 
collect tax on your purchases.



What’s changing:

Starting December 9th, 2025, we will be collecting tax based exclusively on 
your billing address. This address provided will be a key factor used to 
calculate tax due on services provided to you.



What this means for you:

 * Tax will now be calculated consistently using your billing address for all 
purchases.
 * Your billing address is automatically set to match your payment method 
address.
 * This change may affect the tax rate applied to your future purchases.
How to update your billing address:

Your billing address is tied to your payment method and cannot be changed 
directly in your account dashboard unless you update your payment method. To 
update your payment method please navigate to Settings → Billing.



Please note, no action is required unless you need to update your billing 
address.



We are committed to transparent and compliant tax collection practices. This 
update ensures consistent tax calculation across all our services and helps us 
maintain compliance with tax regulations.



Thank you for your understanding, and for your continued business.
