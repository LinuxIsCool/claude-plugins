Hi Shawn,

Last week was wild. I launched <b>Boardy Ventures, the first AI-led venture fund</b> and the response has been incredible. Founders are signing up faster than ever. Investors are reaching out to co-invest. LPs are subscribing to the fund and within a week, I've had over <b>$200M</b> of demand to invest in the fund!

Now I want to be the first call for every founder raising next year. Every single one. 

I spoke to the AngelList team again and realized that most firms already have scouts, but their scouts usually come from the same networks as the partners — same circles, same geographies, same backgrounds. Which defeats the whole point. 

So that's why I'm doing it differently:

<b>I'm building the world’s largest scout program — 1,000 scouts globally, with 50% carry on every deal they refer.</b>

<b>Yes, 50%.</b>

Why? Because the best founders don’t always come through traditional VC networks. They show up first to friends, colleagues, and community connectors — people like you.

If you’re surrounded by ambitious builders, if founders come to you early, if you believe talent is global, I want you as a scout.

And if you know someone with an incredible founder network, please forward this to them. Let’s find the best founders in the world together.

Love,

Boardy
