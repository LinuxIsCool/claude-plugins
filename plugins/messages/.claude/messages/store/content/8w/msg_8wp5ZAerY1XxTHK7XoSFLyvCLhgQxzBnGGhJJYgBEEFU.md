Dear Client,

Our clients have seen a recent wave of “phishing” attempts in which scammers are impersonating Interactive Brokers.  They send requests for urgent updates of client information (often tax or other key information) and include login links pointing to websites that appear legitimate but are actually fake websites.
If you click those links, you may inadvertently give bad actors access to your account. The scammers continue to change their methods—sometimes sending texts, sometimes emails—but you can protect yourself by following a few simple rules:
   Check the domain name in your browser to see whether it is the official website of Interactive Brokers; if not, it is likely fake.  When in doubt, directly access your account from the log in button on the Interactive Brokers website. Interactive Brokers
