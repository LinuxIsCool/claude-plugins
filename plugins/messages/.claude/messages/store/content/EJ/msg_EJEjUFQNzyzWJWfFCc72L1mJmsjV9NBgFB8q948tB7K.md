Today is GivingTuesday! Together, we can help protect what can't be replaced

Hello Endangered Ecosystems Alliance friends,

Some places can’t be recreated once they’re gone. On GivingTuesday, we’re asking you to help protect what can’t be replaced by supporting the Endangered Ecosystems Alliance (EEA). We may be a modest-sized organization, but we punch far above our weight due to our decades of conservation experience, our extensive and deep know-how on the science, geography, policies, and politics of nature protection, and our unique approach to getting results.

From towering old-growth temperate rainforests to native grasslands, from southern deciduous forests to northern boreal forests, EEA is playing a pivotal role in helping to expand the protected areas system across Canada. We build strong alliances beyond the conventional environmental movement, support land embedded communities, including helping advance Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (IPCAs), raise ecosystem literacy across Canada, and much more!
DONATE TODAY ❤️ (https://www.endangeredecosystemsalliance.org/donation?utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=0c0580d3ea-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_12_2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-0c0580d3ea-446069664)
