Hello Family, Friends, and Folks,

We are very excited for our upcoming wedding!!! With only 83 days left
before the big day we have decided to send both digital invites along with
physical invites due to concerns over delivery and the postal strike.
Please find our wedding website linked below. All information about
RSVPing, itinerary for the day, registry, and photos of what we look like
(in case you are meeting either of us for the first time or have
forgotten). Please RSVP by January 14th 2026. We are truly so excited to
celebrate the start of our married life with everyone!

Lots of Love,
Betsy & Brian
