Hi Shawn,

We&rsquo;re officially less than three weeks away from December 31 &mdash; and we still have over 
https://click.email.bcgreens.com/?qs=a0c5e93a7f9ad59a2ee94791f838d0ec59d8b9084f3c9df846fa8644c6a532cece2408e7b873b2914eeb86eeb4156622d468edeb94c49b3c 
$400,000 to raise .

Here&rsquo;s the truth: if everyone reading this gave just $8 or $10, or whatever they can, we&rsquo;d hit our goal.

That&rsquo;s how powerful we can be when every supporter steps forward. And that&rsquo;s why we need you right now.

This isn&rsquo;t just about numbers. This is about survival and momentum. 

Every dollar helps us:

	- 
Elect Emily in the next viable by-election (or snap election...) and expand our voice in the legislature

	- 
Build a party that fights for working families, renters, and people priced out of BC

	- 
Push for real climate action, clean energy jobs, and protections for our forests and waterways

	- 
Challenge corporate power and make government accountable to people, not billionaires

We&rsquo;ve come so far together, but without this final push, the progress we&rsquo;ve made &mdash; the growth of our party, the policies we&rsquo;ve advanced, the candidates we&rsquo;re building up &mdash; all of it's at risk.

So here&rsquo;s the ask:

Please make your contribution today, Shawn. Don&rsquo;t wait. Every donation matters, and every gift counts. This is the difference between building a movement that wins and leaving it all on the sidelines.

We&rsquo;ve already seen what happens when people power a movement. This is your chance to make 2025 the year we secure our future.

With hope, urgency, and gratitude,

Your BC Greens team
