***************
Metrics is here
***************

You can now ingest and query OpenTelemetry metrics in Axiom.

We’re excited to open Metrics for public preview, bringing full metrics support to Axiom’s unified observability platform. Built on our purpose-designed MetricsDB, Axiom now handles hyper-cardinality metrics at petabyte scale, without the cost penalties or performance issues common in traditional metrics stores.

 

With metrics, you can:

*
Unify your observability: Analyze metrics alongside logs and traces directly in the Axiom Console.
* Embrace high cardinality: Track billions of unique time series with no “active series” tax.
*
Use standard OpenTelemetry pipelines: Ingest OTLP metrics including Gauge, Sum, Histogram, and Summary types.
* Explore freely during preview: Metrics ingest and query are completely free, with a soft limit of 100,000 active series.

 

To help you get started:

*
Read the full announcement ( https://axiom.co/blog/metrics )
* Explore the documentation ( https://axiom.co/docs/query-data/metrics/overview#metrics )
 

Metrics integrates seamlessly with Axiom dashboards and monitors, making it easier than ever to understand your systems without juggling tools or sacrificing detail.

 

As with any preview, you may encounter rough edges, and your feedback is invaluable. Join the conversation in our Discord community ( https://axiom.co/discord ) or contact us at support@axiom.co to share your thoughts.

 

We can’t wait to see what you build with complete observability in one place.

 

Best wishes,
