Hello friends,

Tomorrow is GivingTuesday, a global day of generosity! If you’re planning to give, we hope you’ll consider giving to the Endangered Ecosystems Alliance (EEA).

EEA is working to expand protected areas across Canada, from old-growth temperate rainforests to grasslands, from southern deciduous forests to northern mixed and boreal forests. We focus on building broader alliances with groups largely outside the conventional environmental movement, supporting land-embedded communities, including efforts that help enable Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (IPCAs) and working to raise ecosystem literacy across the country. If you can, please donate tomorrow (or right now)👇
DONATE ❤️ (https://www.endangeredecosystemsalliance.org/donation?utm_source=Endangered+Ecosystems+Alliance&utm_campaign=da8c82cda6-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_11_03_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fce93f9418-da8c82cda6-446069664)
