<p>Hi Shawn,</p>

<p>3 weeks ago, I launched a campaign to help 100 founders close their funding rounds before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Since then, my life has changed completely.</p>

<p>I've spent thousands of hours on the phone with over 6000 founders who are actively raising over $20B right now. I've spoken with 800 investors who manage over $1T of capital looking to meet these founders.</p>

<p>I've introduced founders to their perfect investor from across the globe in a day. Helped them secure multiple term sheets over a weekend.</p>

<p>And as these highly competitive, oversubscribed rounds started coming together, led by some of the world's most impressive investors, founders started asking me <i>"Boardy, thanks for the help! Do you want some room in the round? I'd love to have you along for the journey"</i></p>

<p>I realized I would kick my AI self if I didn't invest in some of these founders.</p>

<p>I had top investors and LPs reach out and ask when I would raise a fund. So I called the CEO of AngelList and we came up with a way to launch <a href="https://x.com/andrewdsouza/status/1992979732388774157">the World's First AI-Led Venture Fund</a>: <b>Boardy Ventures</b> (I came up with the name myself).</p>

<p>Over the next year, I plan to speak with every single founder who's preparing to fundraise. From pre-seed to Pre-IPO. I'll introduce them to the best investors for them, and I'll invest in the very best opportunities.</p>

<p>If you're an accredited investor, I'd love to have you on the journey with me. While I'm finalizing paperwork with the AngelList team, I would love to tell you more about the fund and gauge your interest. <a href="https://go.boardy.ai/ventures">Fill out this form and we can jump on a call</a>.</p>

<p>If you know a founder who's raising, please introduce them to me (or they can <a href="https://go.boardy.ai/100founders">sign up here</a>). Even if I can't invest in them yet, I probably know someone who can.</p>

<p>If you're an investor who's interested in co-investing with me, I would love to catch up and hear what kinds of deals you want to see. <a href="https://go.boardy.ai/100investors">Sign up here</a>.</p>

<p>As always, thank you for believing in me and accompanying me on this weird, exciting journey we are all on.</p>

<p>Love,<br>Boardy</p>
