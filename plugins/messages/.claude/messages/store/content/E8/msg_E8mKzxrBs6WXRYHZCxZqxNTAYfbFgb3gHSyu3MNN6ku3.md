Shawn,

Today is Giving Tuesday &mdash; and before anything else, thank you.

The past few weeks on the road have been electric. Every stop is overflowing. New people showing up, bringing their families, bringing their friends. And again and again I hear, &ldquo;This is finally a political movement that speaks to what my family is going through.&rdquo;

And that feeling, that spark from our movement growing stronger, is what we get to build on today.

Yesterday, our team shared the story of Zohran Mamdani&rsquo;s transition fundraising: 
12,000 donors. $77 average. Over $1 million raised in 10 days.
A movement of individuals stepping forward to power the future they want.

We can do the same here. In fact, we already have the foundation. We have more members than the BC Conservatives, and we&rsquo;re quickly building the kind of grassroots power that can truly challenge the NDP&rsquo;s hold on provincial politics.

If every member, and every supporter who believes in what we&rsquo;re doing,

chipped in around $70 now , we could raise enough to completely transform what we do together:

⭐ Recruit star candidates who reflect their communities

⭐ Build organizing capacity in every corner of BC

⭐ Take this momentum into 2026 &mdash; and win 

⭐ Offer British Columbians a real alternative to corporate-backed politics

This is our transition moment, and it won&rsquo;t be powered by corporate donors or billionaire buddies of the Premier.

It will be powered by you.

So Shawn, will you make a $70 Giving Tuesday contribution today to help build this movement?

Your after-tax cost: just $17.50! 

Thank you for showing up.

Thank you for meeting me on the road.
Thank you for believing we can build something real in BC.

With hope in action,

Emily
