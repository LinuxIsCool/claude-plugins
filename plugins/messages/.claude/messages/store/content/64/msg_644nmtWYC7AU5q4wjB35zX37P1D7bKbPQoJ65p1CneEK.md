chhh left a comment (holoviz/holoviews#4196)

Huh, this sounds so straighforward - basically, don't try to be overly smart. If user sets `legend=True` somewhere, it's probably best to just show the legend instead of insisting that there's only 1 curve an noone needs a legend in this case. They might want to make a screenshot of the plot with the legend explaining what the curve is, for example.
