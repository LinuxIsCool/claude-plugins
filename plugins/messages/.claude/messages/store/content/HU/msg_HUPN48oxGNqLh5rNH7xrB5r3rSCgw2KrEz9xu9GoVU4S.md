********************************
What are Events in Machinations?
********************************

Machinations uses Events to run your diagrams. This includes any execution triggered by Step, Play, Predict or Balance.

Each time your system processes logic - like transferring resources, activating nodes, or evaluating formulas - it consumes Events.

************************************
How many Events does a Step consume?
************************************

The number of Events used per Step depends on your system’s complexity. These actions count as Events:

*
Triggered nodes – includes Automatic, Enabling and Interactive nodes as well as external triggers generated by State connections;
* Resource transfers – every transfer involves 3 Events:* Sending resources performed by Sources, Converters, Traders;
* Transferring resources via Resource connections;
* Receiving resources performed by Pools, Drains, and Gates;
* Formula computations & condition checks – any math performed by Registers or State connections.

********************************
Build & simulate with confidence
********************************

Each month, your Monthly Events quota is reset, giving you a fresh batch to work with.

Note: Monthly Events do not carry over, so use them up before your quota refreshes.

****************************
What if I run out of Events?
****************************

Just need a boost? Buy Top-up Events. Buy a Top-up Events bundle. Best for one-time or unpredictable simulation needs. Volume discounts apply. Top-up Events do not expire.

Need more, consistently? Subscribe. Subscriptions are ideal for frequent or high-volume usage. Upgrade for higher monthly quotas and more volume discounts.
