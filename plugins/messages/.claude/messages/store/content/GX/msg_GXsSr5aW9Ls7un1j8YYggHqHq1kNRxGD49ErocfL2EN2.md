Dear Friend of Big Green,

Big Green is powering food-growing organizations across the country.

Your gift backs grassroots growers, leaders, and educators that are turning schoolyards into learning gardens and converting vacant lots into vibrant community gardens that nourish, heal, and connect people. When you give to Big Green, your impact multiplies, supporting hundreds of community-led food growing organizations in our network.

Watch our new brand anthem film (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hscNyiyhwoE) , featuring voiceover by singer-songwriter Aloe Blacc, and see how community-led food solutions are creating real change.

Through our national network, your gift strengthens existing work, scales proven solutions, and amplifies impact.
* $100 provides a grow bag, soil, and seeds to a new community grower.

* $1,000 funds a workshop teaching people how to produce more food.
