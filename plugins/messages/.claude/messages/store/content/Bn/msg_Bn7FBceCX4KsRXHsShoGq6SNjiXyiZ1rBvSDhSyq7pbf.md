COMING SOON*
 

  

Admin advisor for non-enterprise plans (Pro, Business+)

A new page in the admin dashboard will highlight recommended security settings for owners and admins, with links to relevant Help Center content.


  

Huddles just-in-time notifications

Members will receive reminder notifications in Slack for upcoming huddles that are scheduled through Google Calendar or Outlook.


  

Set granular permissions for Salesforce channels

Admins will soon be able to configure more restrictive visibility settings for Salesforce channels, choosing whether users can discover and join channels based on record ownership, edit permissions, or view permissions, which is currently the default.


  

Screen reader verbosity settings

Screen reader users will be able to customize how their messages are read on web and desktop.


  

Message triggers in private channels

Members will be able to create no-code workflows that automatically trigger when specific keywords are posted in private channels. Previously, this capability was limited to public channels.

AI suggested channel sections

A new feature will intelligently recommend existing sidebar sections when users join new channels. Instead of all new channels landing in the default Channels section, AI will suggest where they should go based on the channel’s content and the user’s existing organization.


Upcoming deprecations

  

Audit log retention policy is changing starting April 30th, 2026

From April 30, 2026, we will transition to a two-year retention policy for customer Audit Logs. From this date,we will start to remove any logs older than two years. You can export your data and save it elsewhere by using our Audit Log API or UI. This change is only for the audit log feature and API, and does not impact a team’s retention settings.
