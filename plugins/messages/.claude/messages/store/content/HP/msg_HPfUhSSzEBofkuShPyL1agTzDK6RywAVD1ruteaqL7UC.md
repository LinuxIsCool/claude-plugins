*Hey, it's Camara,*
A couple of days ago I sent out the first round of invites to register for
Masterminding EDEN. You have it somewhere in your inbox. Along the way I
realized that I needed to re-inspire people and help them see the vision of
what we are creating. So I wrote this story. It's probably one of the most
compelling things I've ever written. I'd like to ask you to read it,
please. I can tell you that since I published it I've received a lot of
support and people reaching out to connect. People telling me that it
brought them to tears because it resonated so strongly. It's resulted in
four new applications and eight extremely qualified people that have
applied to the Technology cofounder position.

It doesn't contain all of the puzzle pieces because there's too many to fit
into a short story and there's still many pieces I don't have yet, or don't
know how to integrate as of yet. So please don't be offended if your
puzzle piece isn't in here. But trust that I know that what you're working
on is important and relevant or you wouldn't be getting this email.

I also wanted to provide you with a more comprehensive overview of the
project and plan.

Once you read those I encourage you to register to join us. This is our
moment and together we can accomplish more. The cost to attend varies
depending on which accommodation type a person chooses and it is as
accessible as we can make it. Some of the accommodations are epic. You can
check them out on the booking page as well as see a venue overview here.
<https://mastermindingeden.com/venue>  Yes I know it's in the USA and that
some people have very strong reservations about going there. But this venue
is exactly what we need. It has everything, at the right price.

You applied because you were inspired. Please register now because you want
it to happen and you want to be a part of it. If you're on the fence,
register. This only works if you show up and bring your puzzle piece to the
table. Yes we all want to be paid for our work. So let's create the thing
that takes care of us forever.

There's a surprising number of applicants who are not opening emails. I'm
pretty sure they get stuck in the promotions folder. Hopefully this one
will make it to your inbox. I have to make sure that every applicant gets
this message so don't be surprised if you hear from me or another team
member via your preferred contact method as a follow-up.

If you want to or need to talk to me please book in here:
