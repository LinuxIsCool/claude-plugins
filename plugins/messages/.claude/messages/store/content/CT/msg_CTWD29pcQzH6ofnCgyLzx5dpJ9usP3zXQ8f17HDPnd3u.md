Dear Friends ~

During this important time of giving and gratitude, you’re invited to step
up and support the Y on Earth Community <https://yonearth.org/support/> as
generously as possible this giving season! And, for a limited time,
donations will be matched by an anonymous member of our Stewardship Circle,
leveraging your gift 2x - - - so please take a few quick minutes to make
your donation <https://yonearth.org/support/> today!

Your donation helps to fund our podcast series, enclave gatherings, monthly
ambassador meetups, book publications, and other projects, programs, and
resource offerings... and since it will be matched 2x this week only, your
gift will deliver twice the value to our global community of change makers.

Thank you for your generous support!

With Gratitude,

Aaron and the Y on Earth Community
