This is really shaping up nicely — you can feel the momentum building around making Regen’s tools usable for a much wider audience.

Opening up these AI-integrating components means anyone, from any background or skill level, can start building and contributing to this regenerative economy.

That kind of accessibility is exactly what this niche market needs to truly scale. Excited to see where this goes and how more builders can plug in. 🌱
