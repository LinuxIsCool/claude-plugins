Dear Friend of Big Green,

In the short film above, see how local leaders across the country, like Duron Chavis, founder of Happily Natural Day (https://biggreen.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c083742dc194b327485715fc1&id=a076be2165&e=456cebe6d7) in Richmond, Virginia, are showing what happens when people have access to land and the knowledge to cultivate it. He’s transforming urban green spaces into training grounds for first-time farmers, new food growers, and community stewards imagining a different future.

Watch his story (https://biggreen.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c083742dc194b327485715fc1&id=764821c32e&e=456cebe6d7) to see how your support fuels real, local impact.

Big Green’s network of 170+ local leaders is reshaping what it means to grow food, steward land, and build community power. We identify these visionaries and invest directly in their work.

Leaders like Duron need your support today to keep this work moving forward.

“The easy answer to what Big Green has offered me is funding, but on a deeper level, they've helped me share my lived experience in this food justice space with their inspiring network.”

– Duron Chavis, Happily Natural Day
