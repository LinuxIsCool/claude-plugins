Shawn and Darren, please meet Jason, and vice versa.

You are all working diligently to make the world better with ai tools.
Jason is a friend and colleague and part of the Earthkind Collective, and
Darren and Shawn are founders of the Gaia AI team and working closely with
Regen to build a Regen AI infrastructure.

I have two agenda items I'd like to jam with you three about:

KOI.  Jason, I think KOI is a fantastic infra built by a fantastic team,
and worth having a look at.  We've been using it to build our internal
knowledge graph retrieval and creation system and working towards creating
a knowledge commons.

PACTO and agents for deliberation and regeneration.

Jason has been building pipelines and agents to support high quality
deliberation in a way similar to what I've been trying to achieve with
PACTO, the tool kit to allow indigenous groups and other groups with
verbal, communal deliberative practices and processes to generate legally
and/or constitutionally binding agreements and amendments to digital infra
straight from their assembly process.

See terribly built spec for that here:

onward!
