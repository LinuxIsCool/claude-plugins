## TL;DR – The CTA!

I just launched the first expansions of my **Claude Code and Cursor for PMs courses!**

Nano Banana Pro is truly unbelievable on it’s own, but it’s even more powerful when used WITH an AI assistant.

🤖 The AI runs & manages image creation for you:
→ Helps you write better prompts
→ Generates many variations at once
→ Clones and recreate style of ANY image
→ Builds a reusable system

This is a _complete guide_ to with everything from basic to advanced image generation tips, a HUGE database of images and prompts to use, **all geared toward PM use cases**.

As a loyal subscriber, you get it all free in the links below.

BUT FIRST – I could really use your helping getting the word out.

I’d extremely appreciate if you could **take a moment to comment on the launch posts** on your favorite platform.
