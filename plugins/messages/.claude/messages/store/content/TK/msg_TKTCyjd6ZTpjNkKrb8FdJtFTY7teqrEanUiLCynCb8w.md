U.S. regulatory hurdles lift, XDC Network’s global reach expands

            XDC Network activity and growth have been prolific in 2025. This year saw the launch of USDC on-chain and significant regulatory progress in the U.S.

READ on to learn more about these and other developments on the network.

            In 2025, an entire nation – one with an indispensable role in the global economy – embraced blockchain with open arms. Despite a wall of worry and muted retail interest, advancements in and around the crypto industry have quietly laid the foundation for blockchain adoption to accelerate at its greatest pace yet in 2026.

            A look back

This year’s demand for real-world asset applications drove significant innovation across the XDC ecosystem. Perhaps best exemplified by the integration of USDC and CCTP V2, the XDC Network welcomed new use cases and industry-leading liquidity.

Through its blockchain industry partnerships and participation in global regulatory discussions, the XDC Network not only witnessed a burgeoning digital economy develop on chain but also saw leaders on the network play a role in shaping the industry’s direction as a whole.

In ten countries on four continents, leadership, participants, and users of the XDC Network shepherded the use of blockchain, especially in trade finance, where there remains such a dire need for it. In lockstep, the XDC Network’s financial sector partnerships grew massively as it continues to move to solve the $2.5 trillion trade finance gap.

As we wrap 2025, long-standing initiatives and emerging developments position the XDC Network for its greatest increase in adoption since inception.

If 2024 promised a regulatory framework in the U.S., 2025 delivered it.

This year’s passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) provided the long-awaited rails governing stablecoin issuance and usage in the U.S. It offers consumer protections through strong reserve requirements and provides a safe passage for institutions longing to enter the digital asset space. In the process, the GENIUS Act strengthens the U.S. dollar’s reserve currency status. It also provides the blueprint for more regulatory advancements.

As the regulatory landscape evolves to bring long-awaited benefits to blockchain, the XDC Network made noteworthy moves through partnerships, integrations, and acquisitions - particularly in the payments and trade finance sectors.

Circle launched native USDC and cross-chain transfer protocol (CCTP V2) on the XDC Network, adding another pillar to the network’s position in the evolving tokenization landscape. This positions the network to expand its DeFi ecosystem and drive broader adoption.

The fully-reserved stablecoin provides almost instantaneous on-chain settlement, featuring advanced security and scalable, low-cost transactions. This increased liquidity, reduced counterparty risk, and seamless settlement will benefit trade finance and institutional applications, in particular. Meanwhile, the Circle Cross Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP V2) provides the rails for USDC to move easily across supported blockchains.

This year, XDC Ventures, an investment arm within the XDC ecosystem, acquired Contour Network

https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=5vGV&m=gxfOG3h.4QuaDWI&b=2vgnZY09GZi0wLl0rRfD4Q
. Contour is a blockchain-based platform for digitized letters of credit, bolstering its status as the premier blockchain in trade finance.

Additionally, the XDC Network integrated institutional-grade compliance into its blockchain through a collaboration with CRYMBO, bringing native support for key compliance features such as the FATF Travel Rule and KYC/AML.

In 2025, XDC Network, along with Archax, Verseprop, Spitfire Group and Daizun

https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=5vGV&m=gxfOG3h.4QuaDWI&b=xlRb0LHMeuBQGcUvhx6g_g
, successfully tokenized a commercial real estate finance transaction on-chain. This marked a milestone in the tokenization of real world assets on the XDC Network.

XDC community and ecosystem growth flourished in 2025.

XDC’s community and ecosystem participants continued to cultivate growth and engagement on the network this year:

 • XDC Foundation led the second Plug and Play RWA Accelerator through a competitive selection process, which progressed into multiple integrations by high-performing startups. These integrations kicked off an ongoing initiative to unlock new pathways for onboarding RWA projects, deepen liquidity, and drive real on-chain demand on XDC. There’s also active collaboration between projects from the first and second cohorts, working together to introduce new RWA opportunities and use cases. Toknar, Brickken, Investbay, Raze Finance and Compute Labs have become integrated ecosystem participants from Cohort 2.
 • XDC Foundation hosted an RWA Institutional Mixer in Toronto during Consensus kicking off the first of many institutional events in North America.
 • RWA Night in New York City allowed people interested or involved in real world asset tokenization to the XDC Network.
 • Also in New York, T3: Tokenization, Trade, and Treasury hosted a full-day program and rooftop mixer in New York, bringing together leaders across decentralized finance.
 • The XDC Innovation Lab hosted DeFi on XDC: The Next Frontier, an event exploring how real-world DeFi is evolving across stablecoins, institutional-grade solutions, and practical on-chain utility. Speakers from TradeFi Network, Prime Numbers, and XDC Network shared insights on how DeFi on XDC is driving meaningful adoption beyond speculation.
 • In the fourth quarter of this year, the XDC Network is running XDC Surge

   https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=5vGV&m=gxfOG3h.4QuaDWI&b=067ZcQYMLd4vLfegKRaLug
   , which has allocated $1.25 million in WXDC to boost liquidity across major DeFi platforms, including Curve Finance, XSwap Protocol, and Oku.
 • The XDC Network partnered in 2025 with DAO Maker, which increases access to investment capital by allowing XDC-native projects to raise funds through the platform.

   launched as an innovative platform that transforms how blockchain communities interact and grow together. It creates a unified space for community members to participate, contribute, and receive transparent blockchain-based rewards.
 • The XDC Outpost

   https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=5vGV&m=gxfOG3h.4QuaDWI&b=mEDWGJaSDQegGoGMDct_lw
   platform, created by one of our most active community members,  offers multiple tools for XDC Network developers to assist with tasks, including mobile alerts for node operators, a dynamic repair robot for RPC endpoint issues, PDF receipts for network payments, and a shopbot for selling digital products and collecting payment, to name a few.

Throughout the year, XDC Network and its ecosystem participants communicated with the broader blockchain movement through podcasts – Inside XDC, XDC APAC, and XDC MENA. The XDC MENA Podcast received over 650,000 views on YouTube alone for its 17 episodes in 2025.

Looking forward, several areas of growth will build on 2025’s momentum.

Moving into 2025, the UK’s first FCA-regulated digital securities exchange, Archax

https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=5vGV&m=gxfOG3h.4QuaDWI&b=MnLu1CBJJnk43r7Naay0WA
, integrated with XDC Network with the specific focus of enabling financial institutions to access tokenized RWAs more efficiently and broadening the adoption rate in global financial markets in the process.

Major US exchange listings, including Kraken and Binance US, now provide access points to the XDC Network and support growing transaction activity.

As mentioned, having native USDC on the network, as well as Circle’s CCTP V2 for cross-chain transfers, was central to network growth this year and will provide opportunities for more enterprise adoption. XDC Network is quickly climbing the ranks of USDC-integrated networks, with $125.2M officially issued at the time of writing, per usdc.cool

https://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=5vGV&m=gxfOG3h.4QuaDWI&b=sfxJzF8Y4D..b2lYO.u9Fw
.

More exchanges will begin to support USDC on XDC Network. Beginning in Q1 of 2026, there will also be more institutional participation in digital assets through regulated platforms offering safe onboarding and yield-earning opportunities.

From discussions with current and potential partners, it is clear that native USDC has made the XDC Network more attractive to real-world asset and trade finance participants. It is only the beginning of native USDC on XDC Network, and we look forward to onboarding more partners who handle asset purchases, settlement, and yields using the stablecoin.

Blockchain’s role is poised to rise to the challenges of 2026 and beyond.

During a year when both the promises and concerns regarding artificial intelligence took center stage, privacy has become increasingly pertinent, and secure blockchain networks with historical performance like XDC Network remain even more critical than ever.

A realist and believer in community building, XDC Foundation Executive Director Billy Sebell reflected on 2025 from his unique vantage point—celebrating the wins while reminding the community that there is still so much work to be done.

“Rails are continuously being built, and USDC, as an on-ramp, delivers a major step forward for the network,” said Sebell. “We now have a bevy of tokenization platforms coming together on-chain that will be the foundation for institutional adoption. This only means the work and community contributions must continue, at an even greater pace. Yes, there is more work to do, each and every day. Nothing happens overnight, but the process is there. We must not lose sight of the road ahead as we build for the network and the community, determined to accomplish something meaningful. That is who we are.”
