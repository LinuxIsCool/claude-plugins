*********************************
Supabase Update — December 2025
*********************************

Hey there 👋,

Here’s everything that happened with Supabase in the last month. Be sure to keep reading for a special gift:

************
Supabase ETL
************

A change-data-capture pipeline that continuously replicates data from Supabase Postgres to external destinations, starting with Iceberg. Available in private alpha now.

[Blog Post ( https://supabase.com/blog/introducing-supabase-etl )]

*****************
Analytics Buckets
*****************

Specialized storage buckets built on Apache Iceberg and AWS S3 Tables that provide columnar storage for analytical workloads while maintaining compatibility with the Postgres interface. Available in public alpha now.

[Blog Post ( https://supabase.com/blog/introducing-analytics-buckets )]

**************
Vector Buckets
**************

Vector Buckets are a specialized bucket type built on Amazon S3 Vectors. They are cold storage for your embeddings, with a query engine attached. Available in public alpha now.

[Blog Post ( https://supabase.com/blog/vector-buckets )]

**********
iceberg-js
**********

A minimal, vendor-agnostic JavaScript client for the Apache Iceberg REST Catalog API.

[Blog Post ( https://supabase.com/blog/introducing-iceberg-js )]

*****************
Supabase Platform
*****************

A white-label offering that lets platforms provision and manage fully managed backends on behalf of their users

[Blog Post ( https://www.supabase.com/blog/introducing-supabase-for-platforms )]

******************
New Auth Templates
******************

We now include more email templates to handle security-sensitive changes to you app, including password changed, email changed, phone number changed, identity linked or unlinked, multi-factor authentication enrolled or unenrolled, and more.

[Blog Post ( https://www.supabase.comblog/introducing-seven-new-email-templates-for-auth )] [Docs ( https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-templates )]

***********************
Sign in with [Your App]
***********************

You can now turn your project into a full-fledged identity provider. You’ve heard about “Sign in With Google,” now you can build “Sign in With [Your App].” The immediate catalyst for this is that soon you can build MCP servers that use Supabase Auth in your app to authenticate the user.

[Blog Post ( https://www.supabase.com/blog/oauth2-provider )]

******************************
Supabase power for Amazon Kiro
******************************

With these powers for Amazon’s Kiro IDE ( https://www.kiro.dev/ ), you can build full-stack applications faster by giving Kiro deep knowledge of your Supabase project, best practices for database migrations, edge functions, and security policies.

[Blog Post]

*******************************
Supabase in the AWS Marketplace
*******************************

You can now purchase Supabase through the AWS Marketplace, which means that if your company has an AWS spend-commit you can use it to purchase Supabase.
