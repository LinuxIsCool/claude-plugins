Mapbox has released a new tool that makes it much simpler to upload and manage your custom data on the platform. It's called the Data Workbench. Join us on Thursday, Dec 11 at 9:30am PST / 12:30pm EST for our next webinar as we're excited to show you how the Workbench improves uploading and managing custom data on the platform:

*
Drag and drop your data into the platform with little to no preliminary clean-up
* Preview how your data looks on the map before you tile it
* Edit data directly on the map or in a table view without needing to leave the platform
* Configure how your source data is transformed into vector tilesets with MTS recipes

If you bring your own custom data to Mapbox, this webinar is for you.
