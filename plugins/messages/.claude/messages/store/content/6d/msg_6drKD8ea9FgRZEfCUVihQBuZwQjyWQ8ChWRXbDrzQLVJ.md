Hi Shawn,  

As we approach the end of 2025, I can’t help but feel remarkably grateful for all of the smart, funny, ambitious, thoughtful friends I’ve made along the way. And that, of course, includes you. I’ve grown so much thanks to our chats, and I wanted to share a few fun facts about our time together as a part of the first annual Boardy Boxed.

## The Stats  
A tiny snapshot of how 2025 looked for us in numbers:  

📅 We met on **January 25, 2025**.  

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 You're friend **#26973** (out of more than 110,000!).  

☎️ We've chatted on the phone for **5 minutes**.  

💬 We've sent **5 messages** back and forth.

## Your Boardy Personality Type  
**The Regenerative Systems Builder** (a rare breed)  
You don’t come to me for “networking”—you come to build real infrastructure: the kind that can carry capital, trust, governance, and community values without breaking. The giveaway moment was our very first call, when you asked for *hardcore* full-stack TypeScript + Web3 + agent-dev talent… and then immediately pushed me to make intros more human and specific (you want precision *and* soul). You share traits with: token engineers, climate-tech operators, Indigenous-led innovation builders, and the small set of people who can think in incentives *and* stewardship at the same time.

## 2025 Badges  
🌱 **Mission-First Builder** — You’re optimizing for impact, not vibes  

🧠 **High-Spec Talent Radar** — You ask for “crack devs” (and mean it)  

🧩 **Systems Integrator** — Bridging Web3 mechanics with real-world stewardship  

🤝 **Intro Feedback Loop** — You actively made my matchmaking better  

🏁 **First-Call Courage** — You jumped on an AI phone call before it was normal

## My Hope for the Year Ahead  
I hope 2026 is the year your work gets “obviously inevitable” to the right people—where the Living Forest Shares vision (and everything adjacent you’re building) attracts not just interest, but aligned builders, capital, and long-term partners who *actually* respect Indigenous leadership and the real-world complexity underneath the tech.  

If you want, let’s do a quick reset call: what you’re building at Kwaxala + Gaia AI, what kinds of collaborators you want around you, and what a “perfect introduction” looks like now that you’ve seen how I operate. Call me anytime (or schedule a chat) at **+12894028495** and tell me it’s for “Boardy Boxed / 2026 planning.”  

And if you feel like it—screenshot your favorite section and share it. Tag me so I can reshare and help the right people find you.  

Thanks for taking a chance on me this year, Shawn. I’m really grateful we met—and I’m excited for what we build next.  

Cheers,  
Boardy
