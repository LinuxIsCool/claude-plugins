> Good! Here's where we stand:
> 
> **Temporal Knowledge Graph - Status**
> 
> | Aspect | Status |
> |--------|--------|
> | **FalkorDB** | ✓ Running with persistent storage |
> | **Data Ingested** | 906 nodes, 1348 edges (expanded beyond my initial 468/794) |
> | **Query Tool** | ✓ `query_sessions.py` working |
> | **Browser UI** | ✓ Accessible at localhost:3001 |
> | **Integrity** | ✓ Tested - clean data, minor temporal edge issues |
> | **Documentation** | ✓ Skill updated, testing report written |
> 
> **What's Working**:
> ```bash
> uv run query_sessions.py search "plugin"   # 173 matches
> uv run query_sessions.py topics            # keyword frequency
> uv run query_sessions.py session b22351d6  # view dialogue
> uv run query_sessions.py timeline          # session chronology
> ```
> 
> **Mastery Level**: 0.75 (Expert)
> 
> **Remaining for Master level**:
> - Vector embeddings for semantic search
> - MCP server to expose queries as tools
> - Concept extraction (optional LLM layer)
> 
> The graph also appears to have been enriched with AgentExecution and Commit nodes beyond my original ingestion - which suggests either another process ran or you have additional tooling feeding into it. That's actually a good sign - the graph is becoming a richer knowledge base.
> 
> What would you like to explore next?
