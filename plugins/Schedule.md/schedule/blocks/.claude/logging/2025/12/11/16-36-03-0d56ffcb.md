> OK at the top can you add number of hours per week per legend item? Can you sort them in descending order from left to right?

`16:46:27` 🍄 User
> What should we be mindful of before continuing?

<details>
<summary>`16:47:02` 🌲 Claude</summary>

> Good question. Let me think through potential issues:
> 
> ### Technical Debt
> 1. **Current time indicator** - I added the code but you didn't confirm seeing the red line. May need debugging.
> 2. **Playwright location** - Script runs from `/tmp` because that's where playwright is installed, not portable.
> 3. **XDG paths** - Documented in skill but fetch script still uses `/tmp` in practice.
> 
> ### Data Integrity
> 4. **No conflict detection in UI** - Blocks can overlap (the core has conflict detection, but we don't surface warnings).
> 5. **Manual block IDs** - Could cause collisions if not careful.
> 6. **No backups** - Schedule data is just files, no versioning beyond git.
> 
> ### Missing Pieces
> 7. **No UI for adding/editing blocks** - All changes via Claude or file editing.
> 8. **Unused categories** - errands, class, meeting, blocked, personal are defined but empty.
> 9. **No tests** - Nothing automated.
> 
> ### Fragility
> 10. **Ember Studios scraping** - Will break if they change their Wix template.
> 11. **Server needs manual restart** - After code changes.
> 
> ### Immediate Risk
> 12. **Nothing committed** - All this work isn't in git yet.
> 
> ### Recommendations Before Continuing
> 1. **Commit now** - Preserve v1.0 milestone
> 2. **Test the red time line** - Debug if broken
> 3. **Move playwright install** into the plugin properly
> 4. **Clean up unused categories** from config
> 
> Want me to address any of these before committing?
