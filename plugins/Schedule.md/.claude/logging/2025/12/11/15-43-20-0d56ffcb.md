> ### MCP Tools Available
> 
> | Tool | Description |
> |------|-------------|
> | `block_create` | Create new schedule block |
> | `block_list` | List blocks (filterable) |
> | `block_view` | View block details |
> | `block_edit` | Update existing block |
> | `block_delete` | Remove block |
> | `block_search` | Search by text |
> | `schedule_summary` | Weekly statistics |
> | `free_slots` | Find available time |
> | `schedule_init` | Initialize schedule |
> 
> ### CLI Commands
> 
> ```bash
> schedule init       # Initialize new schedule
> schedule serve      # Start web UI (port 6421)
> schedule list       # List blocks
> schedule summary    # Show weekly stats
> schedule mcp start  # Start MCP server
> ```
> 
> ### Next Steps to Use
> 
> 1. **Install as a plugin** (from your project directory):
>    ```bash
>    claude /plugin marketplace add ./resources
>    claude /plugin install schedule
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Or use directly**:
>    ```bash
>    cd resources/Schedule.md
>    bun run src/cli.ts init
>    bun run src/cli.ts serve
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Through Claude** (once MCP is connected):
>    - "Initialize my schedule"
>    - "Add yoga at 9am on Monday"
>    - "How does my week look?"
> 
> The web interface will show a color-coded weekly grid at `http://localhost:6421`.

> OK looks good. Let's think through our state of development. I want you to help me manage my schedule. Notice that we have created this app as a claude plugin. Should we create claude skills? Can we create a skill that helps us pick our yoga classes for the week / month? I want to be able to pass claude a link to my yoga studio website and have it interactively discover what sessions I want for the coming days / weeks / months.

<details>
<summary>`15:47:57` 🌲 Claude</summary>

> Great question! Let me think through the architecture here.
> 
> ## Current State
> 
> We have a **Schedule.md plugin** with:
> - MCP server (tools for CRUD operations on schedule blocks)
> - Web interface (visual weekly grid)
> - CLI commands
> 
> ## Skills vs MCP Tools
> 
> | Aspect | MCP Tools (current) | Skills |
> |--------|---------------------|--------|
> | **Invocation** | Claude uses automatically based on context | Claude uses automatically based on context |
> | **Scope** | Specific operations (create block, list blocks) | Higher-level workflows with guidance |
> | **Best for** | Data operations | Complex multi-step tasks with domain knowledge |
> 
> **Skills would be ideal for the yoga discovery workflow** because:
> 1. It's a multi-step process (fetch → parse → present → select → add to schedule)
> 2. Requires domain knowledge (how to interpret yoga class schedules)
> 3. Benefits from conversational guidance (preferences, filtering)
> 
> ## Proposed Skill: `yoga-scheduler`
> 
> ```
> plugins/Schedule.md/
> ├── skills/
> │   └── yoga-scheduler/
> │       ├── SKILL.md          # Instructions for Claude
> │       └── prompts/
> │           └── discovery.md  # Class discovery workflow
> ```
> 
> ### Workflow
> 
> 1. **Input**: User provides yoga studio URL
> 2. **Fetch**: Claude uses WebFetch to get the schedule page
> 3. **Parse**: Extract class info (name, time, instructor, style)
> 4. **Present**: Show available classes in a structured way
> 5. **Select**: Interactive conversation to pick classes
> 6. **Schedule**: Use `block_create` tool to add selected classes
> 
> ### Questions for You
> 
> Before I build this:
> 
> 1. **Yoga studio URL**: What's the website? (I can study its structure)
> 
> 2. **Selection preferences**: How do you typically choose classes?
>    - By instructor?
>    - By class style (vinyasa, restorative, yin)?
>    - By time of day?
>    - Specific days only?
> 
> 3. **Scheduling horizon**: 
>    - Weekly (next 7 days)?
>    - Monthly view with recurring?
>    - One-time selection that repeats?
> 
> 4. **Conflict handling**: If a yoga class conflicts with existing blocks, should I:
>    - Warn and skip?
>    - Ask you to choose?
>    - Prioritize yoga?
> 
> This will help me design the skill to match how you actually want to use it.

> Also how are we doing on the general state of the app, what was the remainder of our plan? But for the above, yes by instructor, by class time, by time of day, yep that's all correct. I want you to be able to intuit the monthly schedule so if i just inform you of like the first week then you should be able to take a look at the coming weeks and guess what I'm going to want at any time. We can have multiple blocks in one space like on google calendar, not that we will try to do that, but we will lay our yoga schedule first, then we can think about other activities we want to lay around it. ultrathink

> 
> ## Yoga Scheduler Skill - Architecture
> 
> Based on your requirements, I'm envisioning a skill that **learns your patterns** and **predicts preferences**:
> 
> ### Core Concept: Preference Learning
> 
> ```
> Week 1: You tell me "I like Sarah's 9am Vinyasa on Monday, and the 6pm Restorative on Thursday"
> 
> Week 2+: I look at the studio schedule and say:
>   "Based on your pattern, I found:
>    - Sarah's 9am Vinyasa (Monday) ← matches your usual
>    - 6pm Restorative is with Mike this week (Thursday) ← different instructor
>    - Sarah also teaches Wednesday 7am if you want extra"
> ```
> 
> ### How It Learns (Without Persistent Memory)
> 
> Since Claude doesn't have memory across sessions, the skill will **infer preferences from your existing yoga blocks**:
> 
> ```yaml
> # Analyzed from your schedule:
> preferences:
>   instructors: ["Sarah", "Mike"]           # from block metadata
>   timeSlots: ["09:00", "18:00"]            # morning + evening pattern
>   days: ["monday", "thursday"]             # recurring days
>   styles: ["vinyasa", "restorative"]       # from titles/tags
>   duration: 60-90 minutes                  # typical class length
> ```
> 
> Every time you ask about yoga, it:
> 1. Scans existing yoga blocks in your schedule
> 2. Extracts patterns (instructors, times, days, styles)
> 3. Fetches fresh studio schedule
> 4. Matches against your patterns
> 5. Presents ranked suggestions
> 
> ### Skill Structure
> 
> ```
> plugins/Schedule.md/
> ├── skills/
> │   └── yoga-scheduler/
> │       ├── SKILL.md              # Main skill instructions
> │       └── studio-parsers/       # Site-specific parsing hints
> │           └── README.md
> ├── schedule/
> │   └── blocks/
> │       └── *.md                  # Your blocks (skill reads these for patterns)
> ```
> 
> ### Interaction Flow
> 
> ```
> You: "What yoga classes should I take next week?"
> 
> Claude: [Reads existing yoga blocks → extracts preferences]
>         [Fetches studio website]
>         [Matches classes against your patterns]
> 
>         "Based on your schedule, you typically do:
>          - Morning vinyasa (Mon/Wed) with Sarah
>          - Evening restorative (Thu) 
>          
>          Here's next week:
>          
>          STRONG MATCHES:
>          ✓ Mon 9am - Vinyasa Flow (Sarah) - Room A
>          ✓ Thu 6pm - Restorative (Sarah!) - Room B
>          
>          ALTERNATIVES:
>          ○ Wed 9am - Vinyasa (Mike) - you haven't tried Mike yet
>          ○ Sat 10am - Yin Yoga (Sarah) - weekend option
>          
>          Which would you like to add?"
> 
> You: "Add the Monday and Thursday ones, and let's try Mike on Wednesday"
> 
> Claude: [Creates 3 blocks with yoga category, stores instructor in metadata]
>         
>         "Added to your schedule:
>          - Mon 9am Vinyasa Flow (Sarah)
>          - Wed 9am Vinyasa (Mike)  
>          - Thu 6pm Restorative (Sarah)
>          
>          I'll remember you're trying Mike - let me know how it goes!"
> ```
> 
> ### Extended Block Metadata
> 
> To support learning, I'll extend the yoga blocks to store richer data:
> 
> ```yaml
> ---
> id: block-5
> title: "Vinyasa Flow"
> category: yoga
> day: monday
> startTime: "09:00"
> endTime: "10:00"
> location: "Yoga Studio - Room A"
> recurring: weekly
> tags: ["vinyasa", "morning"]
> source: yoga-studio
> # New fields for learning:
> instructor: "Sarah"
> classStyle: "vinyasa"
> studioClassId: "vinyasa-mon-9am"  # for matching with studio schedule
> ---
> ```
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Next Steps
> 
> 1. **What's your yoga studio website?** I'll study its structure to understand how to parse the schedule.
> 
> 2. **I'll create the skill** with:
>    - Preference extraction from existing blocks
>    - Studio schedule fetching & parsing
>    - Interactive class selection
>    - Pattern matching & suggestions
> 
> 3. **Then we can layer other activities** around your yoga foundation.
> 
> Want me to proceed with creating the skill structure? Just share the studio URL and I'll get started.

> I've created the **yoga-scheduler skill**. Here's how it works:
> 
> ### Skill Created: `skills/yoga-scheduler/SKILL.md`
> 
> **What it does:**
> 1. **Learns preferences** from your existing yoga blocks (instructor, times, styles)
> 2. **Parses studio schedules** from screenshots or pasted text
> 3. **Matches & suggests** classes ranked by how well they fit your patterns
> 4. **Adds to schedule** using the MCP tools
> 
> **The learning loop:**
> ```
> Your existing yoga blocks → Extract patterns → Match new classes → Add blocks → Richer preference data
> ```
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Let's Test It!
> 
> Since Ember Studios uses Wix (dynamically loaded), could you:
> 
> **Option A**: Share a screenshot of the schedule page
> 
> **Option B**: Copy/paste the schedule text from the website
> 
> I'll parse it, and since you don't have many yoga blocks yet, I'll ask about your preferences:
> - Which instructors do you like?
> - Morning, midday, or evening classes?
> - What styles? (Vinyasa, Restorative, Yin, Hot, etc.)
> 
> Then we'll pick classes for the coming week and I'll add them to your schedule. Future weeks, I'll remember your patterns!

> Done! Here's what I added:
> 
> ## Playwright Integration Complete
> 
> ### Changes Made
> 
> **1. Updated `.mcp.json`** - Added Playwright MCP server:
> ```json
> "playwright": {
>   "command": "npx",
>   "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
> }
> ```
> 
> **2. Created `skills/web-scraper/SKILL.md`** - Teaches Claude how to use Playwright:
> - Navigation, waiting, snapshots, screenshots
> - JavaScript evaluation for data extraction
> - Common patterns (cookie banners, login, infinite scroll)
> - Wix-specific tips
> 
> **3. Updated `skills/yoga-scheduler/SKILL.md`** - Now uses Playwright as primary method:
> ```
> 1. browser_navigate → Ember Studios URL
> 2. browser_wait_for → 4 seconds for Wix to load
> 3. browser_snapshot → Get schedule content
> 4. browser_close → Clean up
> ```
> Falls back to screenshot/paste if Playwright fails.
> 
> **4. Updated `CLAUDE.md`** - Documents both skills and Playwright tools
> 
> ### Plugin Structure Now
> 
> ```
> plugins/Schedule.md/
> ├── .mcp.json                    # schedule + playwright servers
> ├── skills/
> │   ├── yoga-scheduler/

> └── CLAUDE.md                    # Agent instructions
> ```
> 
> ### Ready to Test
> 
> The plugin now has two MCP servers:
> - **schedule** - Your block management tools
> - **playwright** - Browser automation
> 
> Want me to test fetching the Ember Studios schedule with Playwright? (Note: you'd need to reload the plugin for the new MCP server to activate, or I can test it in a fresh session)
