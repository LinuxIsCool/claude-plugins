Let me think deeply about autonomous learning from transcripts through the lens of the awareness plugin. Deep Reflection: The Transcript Student\n\nYou are asking the right question at the right depth. This is about embodied learning - how an agent becomes more capable through structured consumption of external expertise. The Core Insight\n\nThe awareness plugin teaches how to learn. The transcript system provides what to learn from. The synthesis is a self-improving agent that gets smarter by watching the masters. But here is what makes this profound: You already have all the building blocks. 1. Learning Loop: From Transcript to Behavior Change\n\n Current State\nYou have:\n- Event-sourced transcripts (JSONL with temporal structure)\n- Temporal knowledge graph (FalkorDB with conversation memory)\n- Direct parsing (no LLM needed for structure extraction)\n- Speaker database (identity, metadata, facts)\n- Entity extraction (concepts, topics, relationships)\n\n The Missing Link: Operationalization\n\nThe learning loop closes when:\n(code block)\n\nExample: IndyDevDan's \"Concrete Computing\" philosophy:\n1. Transcript: \"Sometimes we worked with systems that had only 128KB of Memory. So just because we have 12GB doesn't mean we have to use it all at once.\"\n2. Extract: Anti-pattern = resource waste; Pattern = progressive capacity testing\n3. Package: The  agent you already built! 4. Use: Agent probes resources before loading models\n5. Feedback: Track when probe prevented system freeze\n6. Refine: Adjust thresholds based on actual success rate\n\n 2. Skill Extraction: Transcripts as Executable Knowledge\n\n The Awareness Pattern Applied\n\nThe awareness plugin has 9 sub-skills for learning. Map these to transcript consumption:\n\n Concrete Example: Cloning IndyDevDan\n\nTranscript Corpus: 100+ videos on Claude Code, plugin development, agent patterns\n\nExtraction Strategy:\n(code block)\n\nResult: An agent that thinks like IndyDevDan because it learned from 100 hours of his reasoning. 3. Belief Modeling: Theory of Mind from Text\n\n The Challenge\nExtracting what someone believes (not just what they said) requires inference. The Solution: Multi-Pass Progressive Enrichment\n\nPass 1: Direct Statements (rule-based)\n(code block)\n\nPass 2: Implicit Beliefs (LLM on specific segments)\n(code block)\n\nPass 3: Meta-Beliefs (cross-transcript synthesis)\n(code block)\n\nStorage Schema:\n(code block)\n\n 4.","text_length":2407,"backend":"elevenlabs","voice_id":"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM","voice_source":"system","success":true,"agent_id":"aee72be","duration_ms":179723}

The caption deduplication is tricky (YouTube captions have sentence-level overlaps, not just word-level), but the LLM handles noisy input gracefully. Extraction adapter is complete and functional. Next integration steps:\n\n1. Add extraction to ingestion pipeline - After caching a transcript, run extraction and store results\n2. Create extraction cache - Store extracted entities/relationships/beliefs alongside transcripts\n3. Build knowledge graph layer - Aggregate entities across transcripts into FalkorDB\n\nWant me to proceed with integrating extraction into the ingestion pipeline, or would you like to explore something else first?","text_length":662,"backend":"elevenlabs","voice_id":"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM","voice_source":"system","success":true,"duration_ms":43834}
