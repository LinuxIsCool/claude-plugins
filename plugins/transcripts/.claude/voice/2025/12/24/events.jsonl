YouTube Adapter ( - 450 lines)\n   - VTT/SRT caption parsing with duplicate line merging\n   - Video metadata extraction via yt-dlp\n   - Auto-generated and manual caption support\n   - Audio download for Whisper fallback\n   - Channel and playlist enumeration\n   - Caching layer to avoid redundant downloads\n\n2. 6 New MCP Tools added to server:\n   -  - Get video metadata\n   -  - Full ingestion with auto/captions/whisper modes\n   -  - List channel videos\n   -  - List playlist videos  \n   -  - Batch ingest multiple videos\n   -  - Cache management\n\n3. Verified working with IndyDevDan content:\n   - 1,770 captions extracted from \"Claude Opus 4.5: The Engineers' Model\"\n   - Channel enumeration returns latest 5 videos correctly\n\n Usage Examples\n\nIngest a single video:\n(code block)\n\nList IndyDevDan's latest videos:\n(code block)\n\nBatch ingest multiple videos:\n(code block)\n\n Next Steps to Metabolize IndyDevDan\n\n1. Ingest all videos (there are ~80+ on the channel)\n2. Create speaker profile for IndyDevDan\n3. Run entity extraction to identify patterns, tools, frameworks mentioned\n4. Generate ToM profile as described in your trust-and-autonomy plan\n\nWant me to ingest the latest 20 IndyDevDan videos now?","text_length":1259,"backend":"elevenlabs","voice_id":"21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM","voice_source":"system","success":true,"duration_ms":95177}
